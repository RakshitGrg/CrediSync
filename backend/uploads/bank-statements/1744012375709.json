        "Owl Post Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard. It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, \u201cWitch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless \u2014 discuss.\u201d The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry pushed his",
        "round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read: Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed,Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises. Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen,",
        "because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he\u2019d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer. The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry\u2019s only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry\u2019s dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys\u2019 roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last",
        "two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock away Harry\u2019s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors. This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry\u2019s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admireUncle Vernon\u2019s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept",
        "downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\u2019t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night. Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all because he\u2019d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacation. Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry\u2019s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn\u2019t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call. \u201cVernon Dursley speaking.\u201d Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time,",
        "froze as he heard Ron\u2019s voice answer. \u201cHELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I \u2014 WANT \u2014 TO \u2014 TALK \u2014 TO \u2014 HARRY \u2014 POTTER!\u201d Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm. \u201cWHO IS THIS?\u201d he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \u201cWHO ARE YOU?\u201d \u201cRON \u2014 WEASLEY!\u201d Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. \u201cI\u2019M \u2014 A \u2014 FRIEND \u2014 OF \u2014 HARRY\u2019S \u2014 FROM \u2014 SCHOOL \u2014\u201d Uncle Vernon\u2019s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the spot. \u201cTHERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!\u201d he roared, now holding the receiver at arm\u2019s length, as though frightened it might explode. \u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU\u2019RETALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME",
        "AGAIN! DON\u2019T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!\u201d And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider. The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever. \u201cHOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE \u2014 PEOPLE LIKE YOU!\u201d Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit. Ron obviously realized that he\u2019d gotten Harry into trouble, because he hadn\u2019t called again. Harry\u2019s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn\u2019t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry\u2019s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts. So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks, and this summer was",
        "turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement \u2014 after swearing that he wouldn\u2019t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time. Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he\u2019d finish this essay tomorrow night. \u2026 He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got",
        "out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed.Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table. It was one o\u2019clock in the morning. Harry\u2019s stomach gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour. Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one. Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig\u2019s large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn\u2019t worried about",
        "her: she\u2019d been gone this long before. But he hoped she\u2019d be back soon \u2014 she was the only living creature in this house who didn\u2019t flinch at the sight of him. Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been \u2014 stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning. Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry\u2019s parents, because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered,",
        "murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort\u2019s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. \u2026But Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday. He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realized what he was seeing. Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry\u2019s direction. He stood quite still, watching",
        "it sink lower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside. Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on Harry\u2019s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs. Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once \u2014 his name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords around Errol\u2019s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig\u2019s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and",
        "began to gulp some water. Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol. Harry didn\u2019t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was carrying a letterbearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off through the window into the night. Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol\u2019s package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened",
        "the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out \u2014 a letter and a newspaper clipping. The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read: MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \u201cWe will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\u201d The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend. Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin",
        "spread across his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn\u2019t show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny. Harry couldn\u2019t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were verynice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron\u2019s letter and unfolded it. Dear Harry, Happy birthday! Look, I\u2019m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles didn\u2019t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn\u2019t have shouted. It\u2019s amazing here in Egypt. Bill\u2019s taken us around all the",
        "tombs and you wouldn\u2019t believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn\u2019t let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who\u2019d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff. I couldn\u2019t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it\u2019s gone on this trip, but they\u2019re going to buy me a new wand for next year. Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron\u2019s old wand had snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds. We\u2019ll be back about a week before term starts and we\u2019ll be going up to London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you there? Don\u2019t let the Muggles get you down! Try",
        "and come to London, Ron PS. Percy\u2019s Head Boy. He got the letter last week. Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his horn- rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron beneath it. Harry \u2014 this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there\u2019s someone untrustworthy around, it\u2019s supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it\u2019s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn\u2019t reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn\u2019t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup. Bye \u2014 Ron Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on",
        "his bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought. Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time from Hermione. Dear Harry, Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you\u2019re all right. I\u2019m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn\u2019t know how I was going to send this to you \u2014 what if they\u2019d opened it at customs? \u2014 but then Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I\u2019ve been getting it delivered; it\u2019s so good to",
        "keep up with what\u2019s going on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet he\u2019s learning loads. I\u2019m really jealous \u2014 the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating. There\u2019s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I\u2019ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I\u2019ve found out. I hope it\u2019s not toolong \u2014 it\u2019s two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for. Ron says he\u2019s going to be in London in the last week of the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I\u2019ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first! Love from Hermione PS. Ron says Percy\u2019s Head Boy. I\u2019ll bet Percy\u2019s really pleased. Ron doesn\u2019t seem too happy about it. Harry laughed as he",
        "put Hermione\u2019s letter aside and picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t. His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit. \u201cWow, Hermione!\u201d Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside. There was a large jar of Fleetwood\u2019s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare. Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world \u2014 highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been",
        "the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry\u2019s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom. Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper andglimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped loudly \u2014 as though it had jaws. Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn\u2019t have a normal person\u2019s view of what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin. Harry",
        "poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled. And out fell \u2014 a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crab. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d Harry muttered. The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it. \u201cOuch!\u201d The book snapped shut on his",
        "hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door. Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for Hagrid\u2019s card.Dear Harry, Happy birthday! Think you might find this useful for next year. Won\u2019t say no more here. Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right. All the best, Hagrid It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid\u2019s card up next to Ron\u2019s and",
        "Hermione\u2019s, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left. Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read: Dear Mr. Potter, Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave from King\u2019s Cross station, platform nine and three-quarters, at eleven o\u2019clock. Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign. A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely, Professor M. McGonagall Deputy Headmistress Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there.",
        "But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o\u2019clock in the morning. Deciding that he\u2019d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart he\u2019d made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday cards. Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else \u2014 glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday."

    "Chapter 2": [
        "Aunt Marge\u2019s Big Mistake Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome- home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually. Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on",
        "the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict: \u201c\u2026 The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.\u201d \u201cNo need to tell us he\u2019s no good,\u201d snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. \u201cLook at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!\u201d He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to UncleVernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow- length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed. The reporter had reappeared. \u201cThe Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today \u2014\u201d \u201cHang on!\u201d barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us where",
        "that maniac\u2019s escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\u201d Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law- abiding neighbors. \u201cWhen will they learn,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, \u201cthat hanging\u2019s the only way to deal with these people?\u201d \u201cVery true,\u201d said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door\u2019s runner beans. Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \u201cI\u2019d better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge\u2019s train gets in at ten.\u201d Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back",
        "to earth with an unpleasant bump. \u201cAunt Marge?\u201d he blurted out. \u201cSh \u2014 she\u2019s not coming here, is she?\u201d Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry\u2019s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia\u2019s sister), he had been forced to call her \u201cAunt\u201d all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn\u2019t often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn\u2019t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry\u2019s mind.At Dudley\u2019s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last",
        "visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley\u2019s eyes. \u201cMarge\u2019ll be here for a week,\u201d Uncle Vernon snarled, \u201cand while we\u2019re on the subject\u201d \u2014 he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry \u2014 \u201cwe need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\u201d Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley\u2019s favorite form of entertainment. \u201cFirstly,\u201d growled Uncle Vernon, \u201cyou\u2019ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you\u2019re talking to Marge.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Harry bitterly, \u201cif she does when she\u2019s talking to me.\u201d \u201cSecondly,\u201d said Uncle",
        "Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry\u2019s reply, \u201cas Marge doesn\u2019t know anything about your abnormality, I don\u2019t want any \u2014 any funny stuff while she\u2019s here. You behave yourself, got me?\u201d \u201cI will if she does,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd thirdly,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, \u201cwe\u2019ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus\u2019s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there\u2019ll be trouble,\u201d spat Uncle Vernon. Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a week-long visit \u2014 it was the worst birthday present theDursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. \u201cWell, Petunia,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \u201cI\u2019ll be off to the station, then.",
        "Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry. \u201cDuddy\u2019s got to make himself smart for his auntie,\u201d said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley\u2019s thick blond hair. \u201cMummy\u2019s bought him a lovely new bow tie.\u201d Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. \u201cSee you in a bit, then,\u201d he said, and he left the kitchen. Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door. Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat. \u201cI\u2019m not taking you,\u201d he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him. \u201cLike I wanted to come,\u201d said Harry coldly. \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously. \u201cThird years at Hog \u2014",
        "at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSo?\u201d snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door. \u201cI need you to sign the permission form,\u201d said Harry in a rush. \u201cAnd why should I do that?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon. \u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \u201cit\u2019ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits \u2014\u201d \u201cSt. Brutus\u2019s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\u201d bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon\u2019s voice. \u201cExactly,\u201d said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon\u2019s large, purple face. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to remember. I\u2019ll haveto make it sound convincing, won\u2019t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won\u2019t you?\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But",
        "Harry stood his ground. \u201cKnocking the stuffing out of me won\u2019t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,\u201d he said grimly. Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce. \u201cBut if you sign my permission form,\u201d Harry went on quickly, \u201cI swear I\u2019ll remember where I\u2019m supposed to go to school, and I\u2019ll act like a Mug \u2014 like I\u2019m normal and everything.\u201d Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple. \u201cRight,\u201d he snapped finally. \u201cI shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge\u2019s visit. If, at the end of it, you\u2019ve toed the line and kept to the story, I\u2019ll sign your ruddy form.\u201d He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top",
        "fell out. Harry didn\u2019t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he\u2019d better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig\u2019s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake. \u201cHedwig,\u201d he said gloomily, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron\u2019ll look after you. I\u2019ll write him a note, explaining. And don\u2019t look at me like that\u201d \u2014 Hedwig\u2019s large amber eyes were reproachful \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\u201dTen minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to",
        "Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe. But Harry didn\u2019t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest. \u201cDo something about your hair!\u201d Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall. Harry couldn\u2019t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be. All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon\u2019s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path. \u201cGet the door!\u201d Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry. A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the",
        "door open. On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog. \u201cWhere\u2019s my Dudders?\u201d roared Aunt Marge. \u201cWhere\u2019s my neffy-poo?\u201d Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry\u2019s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge\u2019s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty- pound note clutched in his fat fist. \u201cPetunia!\u201d",
        "shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petuniakissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia\u2019s bony cheekbone. Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door. \u201cTea, Marge?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what will Ripper take?\u201d \u201cRipper can have some tea out of my saucer,\u201d said Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn\u2019t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could. By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea",
        "and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals. \u201cWho\u2019s looking after the other dogs, Marge?\u201d Uncle Vernon asked. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,\u201d boomed Aunt Marge. \u201cHe\u2019s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn\u2019t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he\u2019s away from me.\u201d Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt Marge\u2019s attention to Harry for the first time. \u201cSo!\u201d she barked. \u201cStill here, are you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t you say \u2018yes\u2019 in that ungrateful tone,\u201d Aunt Marge growled. \u201cIt\u2019s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn\u2019t have done it myself. You\u2019d have gone straight to an orphanage if you\u2019d been dumped on my doorstep.\u201d Harry was bursting to say that he\u2019d rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him.",
        "He forced his face into a painful smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you smirk at me!\u201d boomed Aunt Marge. \u201cI can see you haven\u2019t improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.\u201d She took a large gulpof tea, wiped her mustache, and said, \u201cWhere is it that you send him, again, Vernon?\u201d \u201cSt. Brutus\u2019s,\u201d said Uncle Vernon promptly. \u201cIt\u2019s a first- rate institution for hopeless cases.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Aunt Marge. \u201cDo they use the cane at St. Brutus\u2019s, boy?\u201d she barked across the table. \u201cEr \u2014\u201d Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge\u2019s back. \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, \u201call the time.\u201d \u201cExcellent,\u201d said Aunt Marge. \u201cI won\u2019t have this namby- pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what\u2019s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have",
        "you been beaten often?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cloads of times.\u201d Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes. \u201cI still don\u2019t like your tone, boy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren\u2019t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I\u2019d write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy\u2019s case.\u201d Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly. \u201cHeard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?\u201d As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her",
        "eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn\u2019t got a present too.She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame yourself for the way the boy\u2019s turned out, Vernon,\u201d she said over lunch on the third day. \u201cIf there\u2019s something rotten on the inside, there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it.\u201d Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself. Think about Hogsmeade. Don\u2019t say anything. Don\u2019t rise \u2014 Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the basic rules of breeding,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see",
        "it all the time with dogs. If there\u2019s something wrong with the bitch, there\u2019ll be something wrong with the pup \u2014\u201d At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping. \u201cMarge!\u201d squealed Aunt Petunia. \u201cMarge, are you all right?\u201d \u201cNot to worry,\u201d grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin. \u201cMust have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster\u2019s the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip \u2026\u201d But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he\u2019d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could. Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply. It had been a long time since he\u2019d lost",
        "control and made something explode. He couldn\u2019t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn\u2019t the only thing at stake \u2014 if he carried on like that, he\u2019d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic. Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school. His record wasn\u2019t exactly clean either. Only last summer he\u2019d gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if theMinistry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts. He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way. Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the",
        "opinion that he was mentally subnormal. At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge\u2019s stay arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry\u2019s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy. \u201cCan I tempt you, Marge?\u201d Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very red. \u201cJust a small one, then,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cA bit more than that \u2026 and a bit more \u2026 that\u2019s the ticket.\u201d Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into",
        "his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon\u2019s angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out. \u201cAah,\u201d said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. \u201cExcellent nosh, Petunia. It\u2019s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after. \u2026\u201d She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. \u201cPardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,\u201d she went on, winking at Dudley. \u201cYou\u2019llbe a proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I\u2019ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon. \u2026\u201d \u201cNow, this one here \u2014\u201d She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly. \u201cThis one\u2019s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.\u201d Harry was trying",
        "to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers. \u201cIt all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I\u2019m saying nothing against your family, Petunia\u201d \u2014 she patted Aunt Petunia\u2019s bony hand with her shovellike one \u2014 \u201cbut your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here\u2019s the result right in front of us.\u201d Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn\u2019t remember what came next. Aunt Marge\u2019s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon\u2019s drills. \u201cThis Potter,\u201d said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \u201cyou never told me what he did?\u201d",
        "Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. \u201cHe \u2014 didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \u201cUnemployed.\u201d \u201cAs I expected!\u201d said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \u201cA no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who \u2014\u201d \u201cHe was not,\u201d said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life. \u201cMORE BRANDY!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge\u2019s glass.\u201cYou, boy,\u201d he snarled at Harry. \u201cGo to bed, go on \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, Vernon,\u201d hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry\u2019s. \u201cGo on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in",
        "a car crash (drunk, I expect) \u2014\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t die in a car crash!\u201d said Harry, who found himself on his feet. \u201cThey died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\u201d screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \u201cYou are an insolent, ungrateful little \u2014\u201d But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger \u2014 but the swelling didn\u2019t stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech \u2014 next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls \u2014 she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami \u2014",
        "\u201cMARGE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge\u2019s whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. \u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge\u2019s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon\u2019s leg. Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. Hesprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose",
        "floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig\u2019s empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters. \u201cCOME BACK IN HERE!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cCOME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!\u201d But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon. \u201cShe deserved it,\u201d Harry said, breathing very fast. \u201cShe deserved what she got. You keep away from me.\u201d He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig\u2019s cage under his arm."

    "Chapter 3": [
        "The Knight Bus Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart. But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren\u2019t swooping down on him where he sat. Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent. What was going to",
        "happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them. He didn\u2019t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of histrunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He\u2019d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless \u2026 He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic",
        "couldn\u2019t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father \u2014 what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and \u2026 begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn\u2019t sit on this wall forever, or he\u2019d find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak \u2014 but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more. A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street",
        "appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses. He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he\u2019d know whether it was just a stray cat or \u2014 something else. \u201cLumos,\u201d Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew",
        "out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter \u2014 There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light \u2014 With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night. \u201cWelcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport",
        "for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve \u2014\u201d The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples. \u201cWhat were you doin\u2019 down there?\u201d said Stan, dropping his professional manner. \u201cFell over,\u201d said Harry. \u201c \u2019Choo fall over for?\u201d sniggered Stan. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall",
        "was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage andfence. The Knight Bus\u2019s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty. \u201c \u2019Choo lookin\u2019 at?\u201d said Stan. \u201cThere was a big black thing,\u201d said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \u201cLike a dog \u2026 but massive \u2026\u201d He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan\u2019s eyes move to the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cWoss that on your \u2019ead?\u201d said Stan abruptly. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn\u2019t want to make it too easy for them. \u201cWoss your name?\u201d Stan persisted. \u201cNeville Longbottom,\u201d said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. \u201cSo \u2014 so this bus,\u201d he went",
        "on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, \u201cdid you say it goes anywhere?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d said Stan proudly, \u201canywhere you like, long\u2019s it\u2019s on land. Can\u2019t do nuffink underwater. \u2019Ere,\u201d he said, looking suspicious again, \u201cyou did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand \u2019and, dincha?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cListen, how much would it be to get to London?\u201d \u201cEleven Sickles,\u201d said Stan, \u201cbut for firteen you get \u2019ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an \u2019ot water bottle an\u2019 a toofbrush in the color of your choice.\u201d Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan\u2019s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig\u2019s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus. There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the",
        "wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \u201cNot now, thanks, I\u2019m pickling some slugs\u201d and rolled over in his sleep.\u201cYou \u2019ave this one,\u201d Stan whispered, shoving Harry\u2019s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \u201cThis is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\u201d Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed. \u201cTake \u2019er away, Ern,\u201d said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie\u2019s. There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different",
        "street. Stan was watching Harry\u2019s stunned face with great enjoyment. \u201cThis is where we was before you flagged us down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\u201d \u201cAr,\u201d said Ernie. \u201cHow come the Muggles don\u2019t hear the bus?\u201d said Harry. \u201cThem!\u201d said Stan contemptuously. \u201cDon\u2019 listen properly, do they? Don\u2019 look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don\u2019.\u201d \u201cBest go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,\u201d said Ern. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in Abergavenny in a minute.\u201d Stan passed Harry\u2019s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn\u2019t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn\u2019t hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed. Stan came back downstairs, followed",
        "by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak. \u201c \u2019Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\u201d said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw herbag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way. Harry wouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn\u2019t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet. Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily",
        "Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar. \u201cThat man!\u201d Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \u201cHe was on the Muggle news!\u201d Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled. \u201cSirius Black,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201c \u2019Course \u2019e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been?\u201d He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry\u2019s face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry. \u201cYou oughta read the papers more, Neville.\u201d Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read: BLACK STILL AT LARGE Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today. \u201cWe are doing all we can to",
        "recapture Black,\u201d said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \u201cand we beg the magical community to remain calm.\u201d Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis. \u201cWell, really, I had to, don\u2019t you know,\u201d said an irritable Fudge. \u201cBlack is mad. He\u2019s a danger to anyone who crosseshim, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister\u2019s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black\u2019s true identity to anyone. And let\u2019s face it \u2014 who\u2019d believe him if he did?\u201d While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse. Harry looked into the shadowed eyes",
        "of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one. \u201cScary-lookin\u2019 fing, inee?\u201d said Stan, who had been watching Harry read. \u201cHe murdered thirteen people?\u201d said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, \u201cwith one curse?\u201d \u201cYep,\u201d said Stan, \u201cin front of witnesses an\u2019 all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\u201d \u201cAr,\u201d said Ern darkly. Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry. \u201cBlack woz a big supporter of You-Know-\u2019Oo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat, Voldemort?\u201d said Harry, without thinking. Even Stan\u2019s pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus. \u201cYou outta your",
        "tree?\u201d yelped Stan. \u201c \u2019Choo say \u2019is name for?\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry hastily. \u201cSorry, I \u2014 I forgot \u2014\u201d \u201cForgot!\u201d said Stan weakly. \u201cBlimey, my \u2019eart\u2019s goin\u2019 that fast \u2026\u201d \u201cSo \u2014 so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?\u201d Harry prompted apologetically.\u201cYeah,\u201d said Stan, still rubbing his chest. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Very close to You-Know-\u2019Oo, they say. Anyway, when little \u2019Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-\u2019Oo \u2014\u201d Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again. \u201c\u2014 all You-Know-\u2019Oo\u2019s supporters was tracked down, wasn\u2019t they, Ern? Most of \u2019em knew it was all over, wiv You- Know-\u2019Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not Sirius Black. I \u2019eard he thought \u2019e\u2019d be second-in-command once You- Know-\u2019Oo \u2019ad taken over. \u201cAnyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an\u2019 Black took out \u2019is wand and \u2019e blasted \u2019alf the street apart, an\u2019 a wizard got it, an\u2019",
        "so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. \u2019Orrible, eh? An\u2019 you know what Black did then?\u201d Stan continued in a dramatic whisper. \u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cLaughed,\u201d said Stan. \u201cJus\u2019 stood there an\u2019 laughed. An\u2019 when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, \u2019e went wiv \u2019em quiet as anyfink, still laughing \u2019is \u2019ead off. \u2019Cos \u2019e\u2019s mad, inee, Ern?

Mind, I don\u2019t fancy \u2019is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?\u201d Ernie suddenly shivered. \u201cTalk about summat else, Stan, there\u2019s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\u201dStan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn\u2019t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights\u2019 time. \u201c \u2019Ear about that \u2019Arry Potter? Blew up \u2019is aunt!

Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn\u2019t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he\u2019d ever",
        "heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn\u2019t soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid\u2019s face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew. The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry\u2019s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go. Finally, Harry was the only passenger left. \u201cRight then, Neville,\u201d said Stan, clapping his hands, \u201cwhereabouts in",
        "London?\u201d \u201cDiagon Alley,\u201d said Harry. \u201cRighto,\u201d said Stan. \u201c \u2019Old tight, then \u2026\u201d BANG! They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus\u2019s way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it opened, then set off \u2014 where, he didn\u2019t know.Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley. \u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said to Ern. He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig\u2019s cage onto the pavement. \u201cWell,\u201d said Harry. \u201c \u2019Bye then!\u201d But Stan wasn\u2019t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus, he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the",
        "Leaky Cauldron. \u201cThere you are, Harry,\u201d said a voice. Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \u201cBlimey! Ern, come \u2019ere! Come \u2019ere!\u201d Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach \u2014 he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself. Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them. \u201cWhat didja call Neville, Minister?\u201d he said excitedly. Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted. \u201cNeville?\u201d he repeated, frowning. \u201cThis is Harry Potter.\u201d \u201cI knew it!\u201d Stan shouted gleefully. \u201cErn! Ern! Guess \u2019oo Neville is, Ern! \u2019E\u2019s \u2019Arry Potter! I can see \u2019is scar!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Fudge testily, \u201cwell, I\u2019m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron",
        "now \u2026\u201d Fudge increased the pressure on Harry\u2019s shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord. \u201cYou\u2019ve got him, Minister!\u201d said Tom. \u201cWill you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?\u201d\u201cPerhaps a pot of tea,\u201d said Fudge, who still hadn\u2019t let go of Harry. There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry\u2019s trunk and Hedwig\u2019s cage and looking around excitedly. \u201c \u2019Ow come you di\u2019n\u2019t tell us \u2019oo you are, eh, Neville?\u201d said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie\u2019s owlish face peered interestedly over Stan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd a private parlor, please, Tom,\u201d said Fudge pointedly. \u201c \u2019Bye,\u201d Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar. \u201c \u2019Bye, Neville!\u201d called Stan.",
        "Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\u2019s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room. \u201cSit down, Harry,\u201d said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire. Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry. \u201cI am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\u201d Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father\u2019s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn\u2019t to know that. Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a",
        "table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him. \u201cWell, Harry,\u201d said Fudge, pouring out tea, \u201cyou\u2019ve had us all in a right flap, I don\u2019t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle\u2019s house like that! I\u2019d started to think \u2026 but you\u2019re safe, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\u201cEat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then \u2026 You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that\u2019s that, and no harm done.\u201d Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather",
        "like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, and closed it again. \u201cAh, you\u2019re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\u201d said Fudge. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\u201d Harry unstuck his throat. \u201cI always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\u201d \u201cNow, now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel differently once you\u2019ve calmed down,\u201d said Fudge in a worried tone. \u201cThey are your family, after all, and I\u2019m sure you are fond of each other \u2014 er \u2014 very deep down.\u201d It didn\u2019t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He",
        "was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now. \u201cSo all that remains,\u201d said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \u201cis to decide where you\u2019re going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and \u2014\u201d \u201cHang on,\u201d blurted Harry. \u201cWhat about my punishment?\u201d Fudge blinked. \u201cPunishment?\u201d \u201cI broke the law!\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\u201d\u201cOh, my dear boy, we\u2019re not going to punish you for a little thing like that!\u201d cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. \u201cIt was an accident! We don\u2019t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!\u201d But this didn\u2019t tally at all with Harry\u2019s past dealings with the Ministry of Magic. \u201cLast year, I got an official warning just because a house- elf smashed a pudding in my uncle\u2019s house!\u201d he",
        "told Fudge, frowning. \u201cThe Ministry of Magic said I\u2019d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!\u201d Unless Harry\u2019s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward. \u201cCircumstances change, Harry. \u2026 We have to take into account \u2026 in the present climate \u2026 Surely you don\u2019t want to be expelled?\u201d \u201cOf course I don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell then, what\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d laughed Fudge. \u201cNow, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom\u2019s got a room for you.\u201d Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he\u2019d done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn\u2019t usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?",
        "Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper. \u201cRoom eleven\u2019s free, Harry,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be very comfortable. Just one thing, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand \u2026 I don\u2019t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley. And you\u2019re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you\u2019ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cbut why \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t want to lose you again, do we?\u201d said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \u201cNo, no \u2026 best we know where you are. \u2026 I mean \u2026\u201dFudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be off, plenty to do, you know. \u2026\u201d \u201cHave you had any luck with Black yet?\u201d Harry asked. Fudge\u2019s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Oh, you\u2019ve heard \u2014 well, no,",
        "not yet, but it\u2019s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed \u2026 and they are angrier than I\u2019ve ever seen them.\u201d Fudge shuddered slightly. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll say good-bye.\u201d He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea. \u201cEr \u2014 Minister? Can I ask you something?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Fudge with a smile. \u201cWell, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn\u2019t sign the permission form. D\u2019you think you could \u2014 ?\u201d Fudge was looking uncomfortable. \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m very sorry, Harry, but as I\u2019m not your parent or guardian \u2014\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re the Minister of Magic,\u201d said Harry eagerly. \u201cIf you gave me permission \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\u201d said Fudge flatly. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it\u2019s best if",
        "you don\u2019t \u2026 yes \u2026 well, I\u2019ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.\u201d And with a last smile and shake of Harry\u2019s hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, Mr. Potter,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve already taken your things up. \u2026\u201d Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him. Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe \u2014\u201cHedwig!\u201d Harry gasped. The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cVery smart owl you\u2019ve got there,\u201d chuckled Tom. \u201cArrived about five minutes after you did. If there\u2019s anything you need, Mr. Potter, don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d He gave another bow and left. Harry sat on his bed for a",
        "long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry could hardly believe that he\u2019d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago, that he wasn\u2019t expelled, and that he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very weird night, Hedwig,\u201d he yawned. And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep."

    "Chapter 4": [
        "The Leaky Cauldron It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world. Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day\u2019s shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava. After breakfast Harry would go out",
        "into the backyard, take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall. Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (\u201cit\u2019s a lunascope, old boy \u2014 no more messingaround with moon charts, see?\u201d) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\u201cpersonally, I won\u2019t let any of the children out alone until he\u2019s back in Azkaban\u201d). Harry didn\u2019t have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean Fortescue\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes every half",
        "an hour. Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player\u2019s face when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry\u2019s resolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week",
        "after he\u2019d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron. Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life. \u201cJust come out \u2014 prototype \u2014\u201d a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion. \u201cIt\u2019s the fastest broom in the world, isn\u2019t it, Dad?\u201d squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father\u2019s arm. \u201cIrish International Side\u2019s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!\u201d the proprietor of the shop told the crowd.\u201cAnd they\u2019re favorites for the World Cup!\u201d A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom: THE FIREBOLT This state-of-the-art racing broom sports a stream-lined, superfine handle of",
        "ash, treated with a diamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its own registration number. Each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection, giving the Firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision. The Firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable Braking Charm. Price on request. Price on request \u2026 Harry didn\u2019t like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life \u2014 but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn\u2019t ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt. There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went",
        "to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination. Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, lockedtogether in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively. Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters",
        "was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet. As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him. \u201cHogwarts?\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cCome to get your new books?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI need \u2014\u201d \u201cGet out of the way,\u201d said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books\u2019 cage. \u201cHang on,\u201d said Harry quickly, \u201cI\u2019ve already got one of those.\u201d \u201cHave you?\u201d A look of enormous relief spread over the manager\u2019s face. \u201cThank heavens for that. I\u2019ve been bitten five times already this morning \u2014\u201d A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of",
        "the Monster Books had seized a third and were pulling it apart. \u201cStop it! Stop it!\u201d cried the manager, poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart. \u201cI\u2019m never stocking them again, never! It\u2019s been bedlam! I thought we\u2019d seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility \u2014 cost a fortune, and we never found them. \u2026 Well \u2026 is there anything else I can help you with?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, looking down his booklist, \u201cI need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.\u201d \u201cAh, starting Divination, are you?\u201d said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune- telling. A small table was stacked with volumes such asPredicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul. \u201cHere you are,\u201d said",
        "the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick, black-bound book. \u201cUnfogging the Future. Very good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods \u2014 palmistry, crystal balls, bird entrails \u2014\u201d But Harry wasn\u2019t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which was among a display on a small table: Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t read that if I were you,\u201d said the manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was staring at. \u201cYou\u2019ll start seeing death omens everywhere. It\u2019s enough to frighten anyone to death.\u201d But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. \u2026 The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry\u2019s hands. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he said. \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, tearing his eyes away",
        "from the dog\u2019s and dazedly consulting his booklist. \u201cEr \u2014 I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.\u201d Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people. He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin. \u201cIt can\u2019t have been a death omen,\u201d he told his reflection defiantly. \u201cI was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent. \u2026",
        "It was probably just a stray dog. \u2026\u201dHe raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting a losing battle there, dear,\u201d said his mirror in a wheezy voice. As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn\u2019t stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he\u2019d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic. Harry",
        "woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he\u2019d have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned. \u201cHarry! HARRY!\u201d They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor \u2014 Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him. \u201cFinally!\u201d said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \u201cWe went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you\u2019d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin\u2019s, and \u2014\u201d \u201cI got all my school stuff last week,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cAnd how come you knew I\u2019m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?\u201d \u201cDad,\u201d said Ron simply. Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have",
        "heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.\u201cDid you really blow up your aunt, Harry?\u201d said Hermione in a very serious voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d said Harry while Ron roared with laughter. \u201cI just \u2014 lost control.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Ron,\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m amazed Harry wasn\u2019t expelled.\u201d \u201cSo am I,\u201d admitted Harry. \u201cForget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested.\u201d He looked at Ron. \u201cYour dad doesn\u2019t know why Fudge let me off, does he?\u201d \u201cProbably \u2019cause it\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d shrugged Ron, still chuckling. \u201cFamous Harry Potter and all that. I\u2019d hate to see what the Ministry\u2019d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they\u2019d have to dig me up first, because Mum would\u2019ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We\u2019re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come",
        "to King\u2019s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione\u2019s there as well!\u201d Hermione nodded, beaming. \u201cMum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.\u201d \u201cExcellent!\u201d said Harry happily. \u201cSo, have you got all your new books and stuff?\u201d \u201cLook at this,\u201d said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. \u201cBrand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we\u2019ve got all our books \u2014\u201d He pointed at a large bag under his chair. \u201cWhat about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s all that, Hermione?\u201d Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m taking more new subjects than you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThose are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies \u2014\u201d \u201cWhat are",
        "you doing Muggle Studies for?\u201d said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cAre you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\u201d asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them. \u201cI\u2019ve still got ten Galleons,\u201d she said, checking her purse. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present.\u201d \u201cHow about a nice book?\u201d said Ron innocently. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Hermione composedly. \u201cI really want an owl. I mean, Harry\u2019s got Hedwig and you\u2019ve got Errol \u2014\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d said Ron. \u201cErrol\u2019s a family owl. All I\u2019ve got is Scabbers.\u201d He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \u201cAnd I want to get him",
        "checked over,\u201d he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \u201cI don\u2019t think Egypt agreed with him.\u201d Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers. \u201cThere\u2019s a magical creature shop just over there,\u201d said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. \u201cYou could see if they\u2019ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.\u201d So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie. There wasn\u2019t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages. A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and",
        "feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel- encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hatand back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails. The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s my rat,\u201d he told the witch. \u201cHe been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from Egypt.\u201d \u201cBang him on the counter,\u201d said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket. Ron lifted Scabbers out of his",
        "inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look. Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron\u2019s brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone. \u201cHm,\u201d said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \u201cHow old is this rat?\u201d \u201cDunno,\u201d said Ron. \u201cQuite old. He used to belong to my brother.\u201d \u201cWhat powers does he have?\u201d said the witch, examining Scabbers closely. \u201cEr \u2014\u201d The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch\u2019s eyes moved from Scabbers\u2019s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly. \u201cHe\u2019s been through the mill, this one,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was like that when Percy gave him",
        "to me,\u201d said Ron defensively. \u201cAn ordinary common or garden rat like this can\u2019t be expected to live longer than three years or so,\u201d said the witch. \u201cNow, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these \u2014\u201dShe indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, \u201cShow-offs.\u201d \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\u201d said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow much \u2014 OUCH!\u201d Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers. \u201cNO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\u201d cried the witch, but Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door. \u201cScabbers!\u201d Ron",
        "shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry followed. It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging his head. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d \u201cIt was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hermione?\u201d \u201cProbably getting her owl \u2014\u201d They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn\u2019t carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat. \u201cYou bought that monster?\u201d said Ron, his mouth hanging open. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Hermione, glowing. That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat\u2019s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked",
        "grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione\u2019s arms.\u201cHermione, that thing nearly scalped me!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd what about Scabbers?\u201d said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. \u201cHe needs rest and relaxation! How\u2019s he going to get it with that thing around?\u201d \u201cThat reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\u201d said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what\u2019s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he\u2019d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\u201d \u201cI wonder why,\u201d said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron. They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily",
        "Prophet. \u201cHarry!\u201d he said, smiling as he looked up. \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u201cFine, thanks,\u201d said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping. Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him. \u201cThey still haven\u2019t caught him, then?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \u201cThey\u2019ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.\u201d \u201cWould we get a reward if we caught him?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be good to get some more money \u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Ron,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \u201cBlack\u2019s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It\u2019s the Azkaban guards who\u2019ll get him back, you mark my words.\u201d At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with",
        "shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys\u2019 youngest child and only girl, Ginny.Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered \u201chello\u201d without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, \u201cHarry. How nice to see you.\u201d \u201cHello, Percy,\u201d said Harry, trying not to laugh. \u201cI hope you\u2019re well?\u201d said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor. \u201cVery well, thanks \u2014\u201d \u201cHarry!\u201d said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. \u201cSimply splendid to see you, old boy",
        "\u2014\u201d \u201cMarvelous,\u201d said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry\u2019s hand in turn. \u201cAbsolutely spiffing.\u201d Percy scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, now,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cMum!\u201d said Fred as though he\u2019d only just spotted her and seizing her hand too. \u201cHow really corking to see you \u2014\u201d \u201cI said, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair. \u201cHello, Harry, dear. I suppose you\u2019ve heard our exciting news?\u201d She pointed to the brand- new silver badge on Percy\u2019s chest. \u201cSecond Head Boy in the family!\u201d she said, swelling with pride. \u201cAnd last,\u201d Fred muttered under his breath. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \u201cI notice they haven\u2019t made you two prefects.\u201d \u201cWhat do we want to be prefects for?\u201d said George, looking revolted at the very idea. \u201cIt\u2019d take all the fun out of life.\u201d Ginny giggled. \u201cYou want to set a better example for your",
        "sister!\u201d snapped Mrs. Weasley. \u201cGinny\u2019s got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,\u201d said Percy loftily. \u201cI\u2019m going up to change for dinner. \u2026\u201d He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\u201cWe tried to shut him in a pyramid,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cBut Mum spotted us.\u201d Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses. \u201cHow\u2019re we getting to King\u2019s Cross tomorrow, Dad?\u201d asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s providing a couple of cars,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. Everyone looked up at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d said Percy curiously. \u201cIt\u2019s because of you, Perce,\u201d said George seriously. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 for Humongous Bighead,\u201d said Fred. Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into",
        "their pudding. \u201cWhy are the Ministry providing cars, Father?\u201d Percy asked again, in a dignified voice. \u201cWell, as we haven\u2019t got one anymore,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201c\u2014 and as I work there, they\u2019re doing me a favor \u2014\u201d His voice was casual, but Harry couldn\u2019t help noticing that Mr. Weasley\u2019s ears had gone red, just like Ron\u2019s did when he was under pressure. \u201cGood thing, too,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley briskly. \u201cDo you realize how much luggage you\u2019ve all got between you? A nice sight you\u2019d be on the Muggle Underground. \u2026 You are all packed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cRon hasn\u2019t put all his new things in his trunk yet,\u201d said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. \u201cHe\u2019s dumped them on my bed.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won\u2019t have much time in the morning,\u201d Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.After dinner everyone felt very",
        "full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on. The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting. \u201cIt was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing \u2014\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t touched it, all right?\u201d Ron roared back. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Harry. \u201cMy Head Boy badge is gone,\u201d said Percy, rounding on Harry. \u201cSo\u2019s Scabbers\u2019s rat tonic,\u201d said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look. \u201cI think I might\u2019ve left it in the bar \u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere till you\u2019ve found my badge!\u201d yelled Percy. \u201cI\u2019ll get Scabbers\u2019s stuff, I\u2019m packed,\u201d Harry said to Ron, and",
        "he went downstairs. Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys\u2019. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he\u2019d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door. \u201c\u2026 makes no sense not to tell him,\u201d Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \u201cHarry\u2019s got a right to know. I\u2019ve tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He\u2019s thirteen years old and \u2014\u201d \u201cArthur, the truth would terrify him!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \u201cDo you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven\u2019s sake, he\u2019s happy not knowing!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to make him miserable, I want to put",
        "him on his guard!\u201d retorted Mr. Weasley. \u201cYou know what Harryand Ron are like, wandering off by themselves \u2014 they\u2019ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest! But Harry mustn\u2019t do that this year! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn\u2019t picked him up, I\u2019m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s fine, so what\u2019s the point \u2014\u201d \u201cMolly, they say Sirius Black\u2019s mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban, and that\u2019s supposed to be impossible. It\u2019s been a month, and no one\u2019s seen hide nor hair of him, and I don\u2019t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we\u2019re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what",
        "Black\u2019s after \u2014\u201d \u201cBut Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\u201d \u201cWe thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\u201d \u201cBut no one\u2019s really sure that Black\u2019s after Harry \u2014\u201d There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table. \u201cMolly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn\u2019t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Black\u2019s been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: \u2018He\u2019s at Hogwarts \u2026 he\u2019s at Hogwarts.\u2019 Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he\u2019s",
        "had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. \u2026\u201d There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more. \u201cWell, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you\u2019re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don\u2019t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore\u2019s headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\u201d\u201cOf course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn\u2019t happy about it, but he agreed.\u201d \u201cNot happy? Why shouldn\u2019t he be happy, if they\u2019re there to catch Black?\u201d \u201cDumbledore isn\u2019t fond of the Azkaban guards,\u201d said Mr. Weasley heavily. \u201cNor am I, if it comes to that \u2026 but when you\u2019re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you\u2019d rather avoid.\u201d \u201cIf they save Harry \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014",
        "then I will never say another word against them,\u201d said Mr. Weasley wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s late, Molly, we\u2019d better go up. \u2026\u201d Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs. The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\u2019s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle. Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron\u2019s room in search of his badge. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it,\u201d Fred whispered to Harry. \u201cWe\u2019ve been improving it.\u201d The badge now read Bighead Boy. Harry forced a laugh, went to give",
        "Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed. So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He\u2019d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn\u2019t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened",
        "to be. Didn\u2019t people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort\u2019s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him? And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black\u2019s chances of getting inside seemed very remote. No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed. He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn\u2019t look after himself? He\u2019d escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn\u2019t completely useless. \u2026 Unbidden, the image of",
        "the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming. \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m not going to be murdered,\u201d Harry said out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, dear,\u201d said his mirror sleepily."

    "Chapter 5": [
        "The Dementor Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable. \u201cThe sooner we get on the train, the better,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he\u2019s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,\u201d Ron grimaced, \u201chis girlfriend. She\u2019s hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy. \u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got something to tell you,\u201d Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again. They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet",
        "with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she\u2019d made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly. \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d Ron asked Harry as they sat down. \u201cLater,\u201d Harry muttered as Percy stormed in. Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunksdown the Leaky Cauldron\u2019s narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy\u2019s screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Crookshanks,\u201d Hermione cooed through the wickerwork. \u201cI\u2019ll let you out on the train.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cWhat about poor Scabbers, eh?\u201d He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.",
        "Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck his head inside. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cHarry, come on.\u201d Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet. \u201cIn you get, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street. Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron\u2019s disgust, Percy. The journey to King\u2019s Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry\u2019s trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary, though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon\u2019s new company car certainly couldn\u2019t have managed. They reached King\u2019s Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their",
        "trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights. Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry\u2019s elbow all the way into the station. \u201cRight then,\u201d he said, glancing around them. \u201cLet\u2019s do this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I\u2019ll go through first with Harry.\u201dMr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry\u2019s trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him. In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto",
        "the train. Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run. \u201cAh, there\u2019s Penelope!\u201d said Percy, smoothing his hair and going pink again. Ginny caught Harry\u2019s eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn\u2019t miss his shiny badge. Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty. They loaded the trunks onto it, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage rack, then went back outside to say good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him",
        "an extra hug. \u201cDo take care, won\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d she said as she straightened up, her eyes oddly bright. Then she opened her enormous handbag and said, \u201cI\u2019ve made you all sandwiches. \u2026 Here you are, Ron \u2026 no, they\u2019re not corned beef. \u2026 Fred? Where\u2019s Fred? Here you are, dear. \u2026\u201d \u201cHarry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly, \u201ccome over here a moment.\u201d He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it, leaving the others crowded around Mrs. Weasley.\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to tell you before you leave \u2014\u201d said Mr. Weasley, in a tense voice. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mr. Weasley,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI already know.\u201d \u201cYou know? How could you know?\u201d \u201cI \u2014 er \u2014 I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night. I couldn\u2019t help hearing,\u201d Harry added quickly. \u201cSorry \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I\u2019d have chosen for you to find out,\u201d said",
        "Mr. Weasley, looking anxious. \u201cNo \u2014 honestly, it\u2019s okay. This way, you haven\u2019t broken your word to Fudge and I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u201cHarry, you must be very scared \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry sincerely. \u201cReally,\u201d he added, because Mr. Weasley was looking disbelieving. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black can\u2019t be worse than Voldemort, can he?\u201d Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it. \u201cHarry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems to think, and I\u2019m obviously pleased that you\u2019re not scared, but \u2014\u201d \u201cArthur!\u201d called Mrs. Weasley, who was now shepherding the rest onto the train. \u201cArthur, what are you doing? It\u2019s about to go!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s coming, Molly!\u201d said Mr. Weasley but he turned back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice. \u201cListen, I want you to give",
        "me your word \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 that I\u2019ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?\u201d said Harry gloomily. \u201cNot entirely,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, who looked more serious than Harry had ever seen him. \u201cHarry, swear to me you won\u2019t go looking for Black.\u201d Harry stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along the train, slamming all the doors shut. \u201cPromise me, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, talking more quickly still, \u201cthat whatever happens \u2014\u201d\u201cWhy would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cSwear to me that whatever you might hear \u2014\u201d \u201cArthur, quickly!\u201d cried Mrs. Weasley. Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to move. Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron threw it open and stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the",
        "train turned a corner and blocked them from view. \u201cI need to talk to you in private,\u201d Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed. \u201cGo away, Ginny,\u201d said Ron. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train. This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart. The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard\u2019s robes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown",
        "hair was flecked with gray. \u201cWho d\u2019you reckon he is?\u201d Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window. \u201cProfessor R. J. Lupin,\u201d whispered Hermione at once. \u201cHow d\u2019you know that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s on his case,\u201d she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man\u2019s head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters. \u201cWonder what he teaches?\u201d said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin\u2019s pallid profile.\u201cThat\u2019s obvious,\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cThere\u2019s only one vacancy, isn\u2019t there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that the job was jinxed. \u201cWell, I hope he\u2019s up to it,\u201d",
        "said Ron doubtfully. \u201cHe looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn\u2019t he? Anyway \u2026\u201d He turned to Harry. \u201cWhat were you going to tell us?\u201d Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\u2019s argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he\u2019d finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, \u201cSirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry \u2026 you\u2019ll have to be really, really careful. Don\u2019t go looking for trouble, Harry \u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t go looking for trouble,\u201d said Harry, nettled. \u201cTrouble usually finds me.\u201d \u201cHow thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\u201d said Ron shakily. They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was. \u201cNo",
        "one knows how he got out of Azkaban,\u201d said Ron uncomfortably. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019ll catch him, won\u2019t they?\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too. \u2026\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d said Ron suddenly. A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. They looked all around the compartment. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from your trunk, Harry,\u201d said Ron, standing up and reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry\u2019s robes. It was spinning very fast in the palm of Ron\u2019s hand and glowing brilliantly.\u201cIs that a Sneakoscope?\u201d said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look. \u201cYeah \u2026 mind you, it\u2019s a very cheap one,\u201d Ron said. \u201cIt went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol\u2019s leg to send it",
        "to Harry.\u201d \u201cWere you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?\u201d said Hermione shrewdly. \u201cNo! Well \u2026 I wasn\u2019t supposed to be using Errol. You know he\u2019s not really up to long journeys \u2026 but how else was I supposed to get Harry\u2019s present to him?\u201d \u201cStick it back in the trunk,\u201d Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, \u201cor it\u2019ll wake him up.\u201d He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it. \u201cWe could get it checked in Hogsmeade,\u201d said Ron, sitting back down. \u201cThey sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.\u201d \u201cDo you know much about Hogsmeade?\u201d asked Hermione keenly. \u201cI\u2019ve read it\u2019s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain \u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, I think it",
        "is,\u201d said Ron in an offhand sort of way, \u201cbut that\u2019s not why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honeydukes!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s this sweetshop,\u201d said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, \u201cwhere they\u2019ve got everything. \u2026 Pepper Imps \u2014 they make you smoke at the mouth \u2014 and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you\u2019re thinking what to write next \u2014\u201d \u201cBut Hogsmeade\u2019s a very interesting place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hermione pressed on eagerly. \u201cIn Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack\u2019s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you\u2019re sucking",
        "them,\u201d said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying. Hermione looked around at Harry. \u201cWon\u2019t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?\u201d \u201c \u2019Spect it will,\u201d said Harry heavily. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me when you\u2019ve found out.\u201d \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI can\u2019t go. The Dursleys didn\u2019t sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d Ron looked horrified. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to come? But \u2014 no way \u2014 McGonagall or someone will give you permission \u2014\u201d Harry gave a hollow laugh. Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, was very strict. \u201c\u2014 or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out of the castle \u2014\u201d \u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t think Harry should be sneaking out of school with Black on the loose \u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, I expect that\u2019s what McGonagall will say",
        "when I ask for permission,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cBut if we\u2019re with him,\u201d said Ron spiritedly to Hermione, \u201cBlack wouldn\u2019t dare \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, Ron, don\u2019t talk rubbish,\u201d snapped Hermione. \u201cBlack\u2019s already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street. Do you really think he\u2019s going to worry about attacking Harry just because we\u2019re there?\u201d She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks\u2019s basket as she spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t let that thing out!\u201d Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto Ron\u2019s knees; the lump in Ron\u2019s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.\u201cGet out of here!\u201d \u201cRon, don\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione angrily. Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin stirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly open, and slept on. The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and",
        "the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened. People were chasing backward and forward past the door of their compartment. Crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat, his squashed face turned toward Ron, his yellow eyes on Ron\u2019s top pocket. At one o\u2019clock, the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door. \u201cD\u2019you think we should wake him up?\u201d Ron asked awkwardly, nodding toward Professor Lupin. \u201cHe looks like he could do with some food.\u201d Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously. \u201cEr \u2014 Professor?\u201d she said. \u201cExcuse me \u2014 Professor?\u201d He didn\u2019t move. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear,\u201d said the witch as she handed Harry a large stack of Cauldron Cakes. \u201cIf he\u2019s hungry when he wakes, I\u2019ll be up front with the driver.\u201d \u201cI suppose he is asleep?\u201d said Ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed. \u201cI mean \u2014",
        "he hasn\u2019t died, has he?\u201d \u201cNo, no, he\u2019s breathing,\u201d whispered Hermione, taking the Cauldron Cake Harry passed her. He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin\u2019s presence in their compartment had its uses. Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first train journey to Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy\u2019s bidding. They were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut",
        "and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms. \u201cWell, look who it is,\u201d said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door. \u201cPotty and the Weasel.\u201d Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly. \u201cI heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cDid your mother die of shock?\u201d Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks\u2019s basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he spotted Lupin. \u201cNew teacher,\u201d said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back. \u201cWhat were you saying, Malfoy?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn\u2019t fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher\u2019s nose. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared. Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron",
        "massaging his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I\u2019m going to get hold of his head and \u2014\u201d Ron made a violent gesture in midair. \u201cRon,\u201d hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, \u201cbe careful \u2026\u201d But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray, which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept. \u201cWe must be nearly there,\u201d said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window. The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down. \u201cGreat,\u201d said Ron, getting up and",
        "walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. \u201cI\u2019m starving. I want to get to the feast. \u2026\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t be there yet,\u201d said Hermione, checking her watch. \u201cSo why\u2019re we stopping?\u201d The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows. Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments. The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice from behind Harry. \u201cOuch!\u201d gasped Hermione. \u201cRon, that was my foot!\u201d Harry felt his way back to his seat. \u201cD\u2019you",
        "think we\u2019ve broken down?\u201d \u201cDunno \u2026\u201d There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out. \u201cThere\u2019s something moving out there,\u201d Ron said. \u201cI think people are coming aboard. \u2026\u201dThe compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry\u2019s legs. \u201cSorry \u2014 d\u2019you know what\u2019s going on? \u2014 Ouch \u2014 sorry \u2014\u201d \u201cHullo, Neville,\u201d said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak. \u201cHarry? Is that you? What\u2019s happening?\u201d \u201cNo idea \u2014 sit down \u2014\u201d There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks. \u201cI\u2019m going to go and ask the driver what\u2019s going on,\u201d came Hermione\u2019s voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s",
        "that?\u201d \u201cGinny?\u201d \u201cHermione?\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cI was looking for Ron \u2014\u201d \u201cCome in and sit down \u2014\u201d \u201cNot here!\u201d said Harry hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d \u201cOuch!\u201d said Neville. \u201cQuiet!\u201d said a hoarse voice suddenly. Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear movements in his corner. None of them spoke. There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and wary. \u201cStay where you are,\u201d he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him. But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it. Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin\u2019s hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to",
        "the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath itshood. Harry\u2019s eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water. \u2026 But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry\u2019s gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak. And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings. An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart. \u2026 Harry\u2019s eyes rolled up into his head. He",
        "couldn\u2019t see. He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder \u2026 And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn\u2019t \u2026 a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him \u2014 \u201cHarry! Harry! Are you all right?\u201d Someone was slapping his face. \u201cW \u2014 what?\u201d Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was shaking \u2014 the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand",
        "to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face. Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ron asked nervously. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature had vanished. \u201cWhat happened? Where\u2019sthat \u2014 that thing? Who screamed?\u201d \u201cNo one screamed,\u201d said Ron, more nervously still. Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very pale. \u201cBut I heard screaming \u2014\u201d A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces. \u201cHere,\u201d he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \u201cEat it. It\u2019ll help.\u201d Harry took the chocolate but didn\u2019t eat it. \u201cWhat was that thing?\u201d he asked Lupin. \u201cA dementor,\u201d said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. \u201cOne of the dementors of Azkaban.\u201d Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin",
        "crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket. \u201cEat,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019ll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me \u2026\u201d He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay, Harry?\u201d said Hermione, watching Harry anxiously. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. \u2026 What happened?\u201d said Harry, wiping more sweat off his face. \u201cWell \u2014 that thing \u2014 the dementor \u2014 stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn\u2019t see its face) \u2014 and you \u2014 you \u2014\u201d \u201cI thought you were having a fit or something,\u201d said Ron, who still looked scared. \u201cYou went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching \u2014\u201d \u201cAnd Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cand he said, \u2018None of us is hiding Sirius Black",
        "under our cloaks. Go.\u2019 But the dementor didn\u2019t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away. \u2026\u201d \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \u201cDid you feel how cold it got when it came in?\u201d\u201cI felt weird,\u201d said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \u201cLike I\u2019d never be cheerful again. \u2026\u201d Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her. \u201cBut didn\u2019t any of you \u2014 fall off your seats?\u201d said Harry awkwardly. \u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \u201cGinny was shaking like mad, though. \u2026\u201d Harry didn\u2019t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the",
        "beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had? Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, \u201cI haven\u2019t poisoned that chocolate, you know. \u2026\u201d Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes. \u201cWe\u2019ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered, embarrassed. They didn\u2019t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville\u2019s pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets. \u201cFirs\u2019 years this",
        "way!\u201d called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake. \u201cAll righ\u2019, you three?\u201d Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermionefollowed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession. The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but",
        "still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again. As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out. As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear. \u201cYou fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth? You actually fainted?\u201d Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry\u2019s",
        "way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously. \u201cShove off, Malfoy,\u201d said Ron, whose jaw was clenched. \u201cDid you faint as well, Weasley?\u201d said Malfoy loudly. \u201cDid the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?\u201d \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage. Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, \u201cOh, no \u2014er \u2014 Professor,\u201d then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle. Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with",
        "flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors. The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \u201cPotter! Granger! I want to see you both!\u201d Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to look so worried \u2014 I just want a word in my office,\u201d she told them. \u201cMove along there, Weasley.\u201d",
        "Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor. Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, \u201cProfessor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.\u201d Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in. Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he\u2019d passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this fuss.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t need anything \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at",
        "him. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve been doing something dangerous again?\u201d \u201cIt was a dementor, Poppy,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly. \u201cSetting dementors around a school,\u201d she muttered, pushing back Harry\u2019s hair and feeling his forehead. \u201cHe won\u2019t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he\u2019s all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not delicate!\u201d said Harry crossly. \u201cOf course you\u2019re not,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking his pulse. \u201cWhat does he need?\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cBed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture. \u201cWell, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to",
        "peer into Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve already had some,\u201d said Harry. \u201cProfessor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.\u201d \u201cDid he, now?\u201d said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. \u201cSo we\u2019ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?\u201d \u201cAre you sure you feel all right, Potter?\u201d Professor McGonagall said sharply. \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cVery well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast together.\u201d Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to herself. He hadto wait only a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall. It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of",
        "the long House tables was lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall. \u201cOh,\u201d said Hermione softly, \u201cwe\u2019ve missed the Sorting!\u201d New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing in front",
        "of the dementor traveled that fast? He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them seats. \u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d he muttered to Harry. Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he broke off. Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn\u2019t why Harry respected him. You couldn\u2019t help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment. \u201cWelcome!\u201d said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard. \u201cWelcome to another year at Hogwarts! I havea few things to",
        "say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast. \u2026\u201d Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, \u201cAs you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.\u201d He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school. \u201cThey are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cand while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises \u2014 or even Invisibility Cloaks,\u201d he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \u201cIt",
        "is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,\u201d he said. Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound. \u201cOn a happier note,\u201d he continued, \u201cI am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. \u201cFirst, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\u201d There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped",
        "hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes. \u201cLook at Snape!\u201d Ron hissed in Harry\u2019s ear. Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was commonknowledge that Snape wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry. \u201cAs to our second new appointment,\u201d Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. \u201cWell, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am",
        "delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard. \u201cWe should\u2019ve known!\u201d Ron roared, pounding the table. \u201cWho else would have assigned us a biting book?\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth. \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s everything of importance,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cLet the feast begin!\u201d The golden plates and goblets before them",
        "filled suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat. It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn\u2019t a fully qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts inhis third year for a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid\u2019s name last year. At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed, and they got their chance. \u201cCongratulations, Hagrid!\u201d Hermione squealed as they reached the teachers\u2019 table.",
        "\u201cAll down ter you three,\u201d said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them. \u201cCan\u2019 believe it \u2026 great man, Dumbledore \u2026 came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn said he\u2019d had enough. \u2026 It\u2019s what I always wanted. \u2026\u201d Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, \u201cPassword?\u201d \u201cComing through, coming through!\u201d Percy called from behind the crowd. \u201cThe new password\u2019s \u2018Fortuna Major\u2019!\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble remembering the passwords. Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys",
        "divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last."

    "Chapter 6": [
        "Talons and Tea Leaves When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter. \u201cIgnore him,\u201d said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \u201cJust ignore him, it\u2019s not worth it. \u2026\u201d \u201cHey, Potter!\u201d shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. \u201cPotter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooo!\u201d Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George Weasley. \u201cNew third-year course schedules,\u201d said George, passing them over. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Harry?\u201d \u201cMalfoy,\u201d said Ron, sitting down on George\u2019s other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table. George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending",
        "to faint with terror again. \u201cThat little git,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came running into our compartment, didn\u2019t he, Fred?\u201d\u201cNearly wet himself,\u201d said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too happy myself,\u201d said George. \u201cThey\u2019re horrible things, those dementors. \u2026\u201d \u201cSort of freeze your insides, don\u2019t they?\u201d said Fred. \u201cYou didn\u2019t pass out, though, did you?\u201d said Harry in a low voice. \u201cForget it, Harry,\u201d said George bracingly. \u201cDad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he\u2019d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking. \u2026 They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.\u201d \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match,\u201d said Fred. \u201cGryffindor versus",
        "Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?\u201d The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes. Hermione was examining her new schedule. \u201cOoh, good, we\u2019re starting some new subjects today,\u201d she said happily. \u201cHermione,\u201d said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, \u201cthey\u2019ve messed up your schedule. Look \u2014 they\u2019ve got you down for about ten subjects a day. There isn\u2019t enough time.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll manage. I\u2019ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\u201d \u201cBut look,\u201d said Ron, laughing, \u201csee this morning? Nine o\u2019clock, Divination. And underneath, nine o\u2019clock, Muggle Studies. And\u201d \u2014 Ron leaned closer to the schedule, disbelieving \u2014 \u201clook \u2014 underneath that, Arithmancy, nine o\u2019clock. I mean, I know you\u2019re good, Hermione, but no one\u2019s that good. How\u2019re you supposed to be in three classes",
        "at once?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Hermione shortly. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t be in three classes at once.\u201d \u201cWell, then \u2014\u201d\u201cPass the marmalade,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, Ron, what\u2019s it to you if my schedule\u2019s a bit full?\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.\u201d Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand. \u201cAll righ\u2019?\u201d he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff table. \u201cYer in my firs\u2019 ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up since five gettin\u2019 everythin\u2019 ready. \u2026 Hope it\u2019s okay. \u2026 Me, a teacher \u2026 hones\u2019ly. \u2026\u201d He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging the polecat. \u201cWonder what he\u2019s been getting ready?\u201d said Ron, a note of anxiety in his voice. The hall was",
        "starting to empty as people headed off toward their first lesson. Ron checked his course schedule. \u201cWe\u2019d better go, look, Divination\u2019s at the top of North Tower. It\u2019ll take us ten minutes to get there. \u2026\u201d They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred and George, and walked back through the hall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of laughter followed Harry into the entrance hall. The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn\u2019t taught them everything about the castle, and they had never been inside North Tower before. \u201cThere\u2019s \u2014 got \u2014 to \u2014 be \u2014 a \u2014 shortcut,\u201d Ron panted as they climbed their seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass",
        "hanging on the stone wall. \u201cI think it\u2019s this way,\u201d said Hermione, peering down the empty passage to the right.\u201cCan\u2019t be,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThat\u2019s south, look, you can see a bit of the lake out of the window \u2026\u201d Harry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-gray pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit one another, but he always enjoyed watching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his pony. By the look of the grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off. \u201cAha!\u201d he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cWhat villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!\u201d They watched",
        "in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Harry, moving closer to the picture. \u201cGet back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\u201d The knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he couldn\u2019t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face. \u201cListen,\u201d said Harry, taking advantage of the knight\u2019s exhaustion, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for the North Tower. You don\u2019t know the way, do you?\u201d \u201cA quest!\u201d The knight\u2019s rage seemed to",
        "vanish instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, \u201cCome follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\u201d He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, \u201cOn foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!\u201dAnd he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of sight. They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead. \u201cBe of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!\u201d yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase. Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and",
        "dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom. \u201cFarewell!\u201d cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks. \u201cFarewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!\u201d \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll call you,\u201d muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, \u201cif we ever need someone mental.\u201d They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it. \u201c \u2018Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,\u2019 \u201d Harry read. \u201cHow\u2019re we supposed to get up there?\u201d As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry\u2019s feet.",
        "Everyone got quiet. \u201cAfter you,\u201d said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first. He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn\u2019t look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone\u2019s attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light;the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of",
        "teacups. Ron appeared at Harry\u2019s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Ron said. A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice. \u201cWelcome,\u201d it said. \u201cHow nice to see you in the physical world at last.\u201d Harry\u2019s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings. \u201cSit, my children, sit,\u201d she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table. \u201cWelcome to Divination,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, who had seated",
        "herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \u201cMy name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.\u201d Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \u201cSo you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there isvery little I will be able to teach you. Books can take you only so far in this field. \u2026\u201d At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn\u2019t be much help in this subject. \u201cMany witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden",
        "disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\u201d Professor Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \u201cIt is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\u201d she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. \u201cIs your grandmother well?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d said Neville tremulously. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure if I were you, dear,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. \u201cWe will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\u201d she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \u201cbeware a red-haired man.\u201d Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her, and edged her chair away from him. \u201cIn the second term,\u201d",
        "Professor Trelawney went on, \u201cwe shall progress to the crystal ball \u2014 if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.\u201d A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it. \u201cI wonder, dear,\u201d she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \u201cif you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\u201d Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on the table in frontof Professor Trelawney. \u201cThank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading \u2014 it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\u201d Lavender trembled. \u201cNow, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the",
        "shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear\u201d \u2014 she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up \u2014 \u201cafter you\u2019ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I\u2019m rather attached to the pink.\u201d Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding",
        "a dustpan and brush and said, \u201cOne of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn\u2019t mind \u2026 thank you. \u2026\u201d When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped over. \u201cRight,\u201d said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. \u201cWhat can you see in mine?\u201d \u201cA load of soggy brown stuff,\u201d said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid. \u201cBroaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane!\u201d Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom. Harry tried to pull himself together.\u201cRight, you\u2019ve got a crooked sort of cross \u2026\u201d He consulted Unfogging the Future. \u201cThat means you\u2019re going to have \u2018trials and",

        "animal \u2026 yeah, if that was its head \u2026 it looks like a hippo \u2026 no, a sheep \u2026\u201d Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter. \u201cLet me see that, my dear,\u201d she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry\u2019s cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch. Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise. \u201cThe falcon \u2026 my dear, you have a deadly enemy.\u201d \u201cBut everyone knows that,\u201d said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her. \u201cWell, they do,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cEverybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.\u201d Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to Harry\u2019s cup again and continued to turn it.\u201cThe club \u2026 an attack.",
        "Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup. \u2026\u201d \u201cI thought that was a bowler hat,\u201d said Ron sheepishly. \u201cThe skull \u2026 danger in your path, my dear. \u2026\u201d Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed. There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed. \u201cMy dear boy \u2026 my poor, dear boy \u2026 no \u2026 it is kinder not to say \u2026 no \u2026 don\u2019t ask me. \u2026\u201d \u201cWhat is it, Professor?\u201d said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron\u2019s table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney\u2019s chair to get a good look at Harry\u2019s cup. \u201cMy dear,\u201d Professor Trelawney\u2019s huge eyes opened dramatically, \u201cyou have the",
        "Grim.\u201d \u201cThe what?\u201d said Harry. He could tell that he wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror. \u201cThe Grim, my dear, the Grim!\u201d cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn\u2019t understood. \u201cThe giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen \u2014 the worst omen \u2014 of death!\u201d Harry\u2019s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts \u2014 the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent \u2026 Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney\u2019s chair. \u201cI don\u2019t think it looks like a Grim,\u201d she said flatly. Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.\u201cYou\u2019ll",
        "forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.\u201d Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side. \u201cIt looks like a Grim if you do this,\u201d he said, with his eyes almost shut, \u201cbut it looks more like a donkey from here,\u201d he said, leaning to the left. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve all finished deciding whether I\u2019m going to die or not!\u201d said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him. \u201cI think we will leave the lesson here for today,\u201d said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice. \u201cYes \u2026 please pack away your things. \u2026\u201d Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cUntil we meet again,\u201d said Professor Trelawney faintly,",

Oh, and dear\u201d \u2014 she pointed at Neville \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019ll be late next time, so mind you work extra- hard to catch up.\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney\u2019s ladder and the winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall\u2019s Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that, early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time. Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn\u2019t even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby",
        "cat with spectacle markings around her eyes. \u201cReally, what has got into you all today?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them all. \u201cNot that it matters, but that\u2019sthe first time my transformation\u2019s not got applause from a class.\u201d Everybody\u2019s heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand. \u201cPlease, Professor, we\u2019ve just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and \u2014\u201d \u201cAh, of course,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. \u201cThere is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?\u201d Everyone stared at her. \u201cMe,\u201d said Harry, finally. \u201cI see,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \u201cThen you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school.",
        "None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues \u2014\u201d Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, \u201cDivination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney \u2014\u201d She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \u201cYou look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don\u2019t let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in.\u201d Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away",
        "from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney\u2019s classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \u201cBut what about Neville\u2019s cup?\u201d When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.\u201cRon, cheer up,\u201d said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. \u201cYou heard what Professor McGonagall said.\u201d Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn\u2019t start. \u201cHarry,\u201d he said, in a low, serious voice, \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?\u201d \u201cYeah, I have,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI saw one the night I left the Dursleys\u2019.\u201d Ron let his fork fall with a clatter. \u201cProbably a stray,\u201d said Hermione calmly. Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad. \u201cHermione, if Harry\u2019s seen a Grim, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cMy \u2014 my uncle Bilius",

The Grim\u2019s not an omen, it\u2019s the cause of death! And Harry\u2019s still with us because he\u2019s not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I\u2019d better kick the bucket then!\u201d Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug. \u201cI think Divination seems very woolly,\u201d she said, searching for her page. \u201cA lot of guesswork, if you ask me.\u201d \u201cThere was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!\u201d said Ron hotly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t",
        "seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,\u201d said Hermione coolly. \u201cProfessor Trelawney said you didn\u2019t have the right aura! You just don\u2019t like being bad at something for a change!\u201d He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits ofmeat and carrot flew everywhere. \u201cIf being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!\u201d She snatched up her bag and stalked away. Ron frowned after her. \u201cWhat\u2019s she talking about?\u201d he said to Harry. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been to an Arithmancy class yet.\u201d Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch.

Harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid\u2019s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three only-too-familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about. Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start. \u201cC\u2019mon, now, get a move on!\u201d he called as the class approached. \u201cGot a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin\u2019 up! Everyone here?",
        "Right, follow me!\u201d For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock. There was nothing in there. \u201cEveryone gather \u2019round the fence here!\u201d he called. \u201cThat\u2019s it \u2014 make sure yeh can see \u2014 now, firs\u2019 thing yeh\u2019ll want ter do is open yer books \u2014\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. \u201cEh?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHow do we open our books?\u201d Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or",
        "clamped them together with binder clips. \u201cHasn\u2019 \u2014 hasn\u2019 anyone bin able ter open their books?\u201d said Hagrid, looking crestfallen. The class all shook their heads. \u201cYeh\u2019ve got ter stroke \u2019em,\u201d said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cLook \u2014\u201d He took Hermione\u2019s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand. \u201cOh, how silly we\u2019ve all been!\u201d Malfoy sneered. \u201cWe should have stroked them! Why didn\u2019t we guess!\u201d \u201cI \u2014 I thought they were funny,\u201d Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione. \u201cOh, tremendously funny!\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cReally witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off!\u201d \u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid\u2019s first lesson to be",
        "a success. \u201cRigh\u2019 then,\u201d said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, \u201cso \u2014 so yeh\u2019ve got yer books an\u2019 \u2014 an\u2019 \u2014 now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I\u2019ll go an\u2019 get \u2019em. Hang on \u2026\u201d He strode away from them into the forest and out of sight. \u201cGod, this place is going to the dogs,\u201d said Malfoy loudly. \u201cThat oaf teaching classes, my father\u2019ll have a fit when I tell him \u2014\u201d \u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cCareful, Potter, there\u2019s a dementor behind you \u2014\u201d\u201cOooooooh!\u201d squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock. Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel- colored beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes.",
        "The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures. \u201cGee up, there!\u201d he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. \u201cHippogriffs!\u201d Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \u201cBeau\u2019iful, aren\u2019 they?\u201d Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs\u2019 gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze,",
        "pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. \u201cSo,\u201d said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \u201cif yeh wan\u2019 ter come a bit nearer \u2014\u201d No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously. \u201cNow, firs\u2019 thing yeh gotta know abou\u2019 hippogriffs is, they\u2019re proud,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cEasily offended, hippogriffs are. Don\u2019t never insult one, \u2019cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\u201d Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren\u2019t listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. \u201cYeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs\u2019 move,\u201d Hagrid continued. \u201cIt\u2019s polite, see? Yeh walk towardhim, and yeh bow, an\u2019 yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh\u2019re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn\u2019 bow, then get away from him sharpish, \u2019cause those talons hurt. \u201cRight \u2014 who wants",
        "ter go first?\u201d Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn\u2019t seem to like being tethered like this. \u201cNo one?\u201d said Hagrid, with a pleading look. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Harry. There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \u201cOooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\u201d Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence. \u201cGood man, Harry!\u201d roared Hagrid. \u201cRight then \u2014 let\u2019s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\u201d He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy\u2019s eyes were narrowed maliciously. \u201cEasy, now, Harry,\u201d said Hagrid quietly. \u201cYeh\u2019ve got eye contact,",
        "now try not ter blink. \u2026 Hippogriffs don\u2019 trust yeh if yeh blink too much. \u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes immediately began to water, but he didn\u2019t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. \u201cTha\u2019s it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cTha\u2019s it, Harry \u2026 now, bow \u2026\u201d Harry didn\u2019t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up. The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn\u2019t move. \u201cAh,\u201d said Hagrid, sounding worried. \u201cRight \u2014 back away, now, Harry, easy does it \u2014\u201d But then, to Harry\u2019s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.\u201cWell done, Harry!\u201d said Hagrid, ecstatic. \u201cRight \u2014 yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!\u201d Feeling that",
        "a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it. The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed. \u201cRigh\u2019 then, Harry,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cI reckon he might\u2019 let yeh ride him!\u201d This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn\u2019t sure a hippogriff would be quite the same. \u201cYeh climb up there, jus\u2019 behind the wing joint,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201can\u2019 mind yeh don\u2019 pull any of his feathers out, he won\u2019 like that. \u2026\u201d Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak\u2019s wing and hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn\u2019t sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was",
        "covered with feathers. \u201cGo on, then!\u201d roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff\u2019s hindquarters. Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry; he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff\u2019s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn\u2019t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings. Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had beendreading; he leaned back as the smooth",
        "neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again. \u201cGood work, Harry!\u201d roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \u201cOkay, who else wants a go?\u201d Emboldened by Harry\u2019s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from his, which didn\u2019t seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful. \u201cThis is very easy,\u201d Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to hear him. \u201cI knew it must have",
        "been, if Potter could do it. \u2026 I bet you\u2019re not dangerous at all, are you?\u201d he said to the hippogriff. \u201cAre you, you great ugly brute?\u201d It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes. \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \u201cI\u2019m dying, look at me! It\u2019s killed me!\u201d \u201cYer not dyin\u2019!\u201d said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \u201cSomeone help me \u2014 gotta get him outta here \u2014\u201d Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy\u2019s arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward the castle. Very shaken,",
        "the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.\u201cThey should fire him straight away!\u201d said Pansy Parkinson, who was in tears. \u201cIt was Malfoy\u2019s fault!\u201d snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly. They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if he\u2019s okay!\u201d said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower. \u201cD\u2019you think he\u2019ll be all right?\u201d said Hermione nervously. \u201c \u2019Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,\u201d said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse. \u201cThat was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid\u2019s first class, though, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron,",
        "looking worried. \u201cTrust Malfoy to mess things up for him. \u2026\u201d They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn\u2019t there. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t fire him, would they?\u201d said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney pudding. \u201cThey\u2019d better not,\u201d said Ron, who wasn\u2019t eating either. Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t an interesting first day back,\u201d said Ron gloomily. They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window. \u201cThere\u2019s a light on in Hagrid\u2019s window,\u201d Harry said suddenly.",
        "Ron looked at his watch.\u201cIf we hurried, we could go down and see him. It\u2019s still quite early. \u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to walk across the grounds,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cSirius Black hasn\u2019t got past the dementors yet, has he?\u201d So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren\u2019t entirely sure they were supposed to be out. The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When they reached Hagrid\u2019s hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, \u201cC\u2019min.\u201d Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid\u2019s lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big",
        "as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus. \u201c \u2019Spect it\u2019s a record,\u201d he said thickly, when he recognized them. \u201cDon\u2019 reckon they\u2019ve ever had a teacher who lasted on\u2019y a day before.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t been fired, Hagrid!\u201d gasped Hermione. \u201cNot yet,\u201d said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard. \u201cBut \u2019s only a matter o\u2019 time, i\u2019n\u2019t it, after Malfoy \u2026\u201d \u201cHow is he?\u201d said Ron as they all sat down. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t serious, was it?\u201d \u201cMadam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,\u201d said Hagrid dully, \u201cbut he\u2019s sayin\u2019 it\u2019s still agony \u2026 covered in bandages \u2026 moanin\u2019 \u2026\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s faking it,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cMadam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d \u201cSchool gov\u2019nors have bin told, o\u2019 course,\u201d",
        "said Hagrid miserably. \u201cThey reckon I started too big. Shoulda lefthippogriffs fer later \u2026 done flobberworms or summat. \u2026 Jus\u2019 thought it\u2019d make a good firs\u2019 lesson. \u2026 \u2019S all my fault. \u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all Malfoy\u2019s fault, Hagrid!\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cWe\u2019re witnesses,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It\u2019s Malfoy\u2019s problem that he wasn\u2019t listening. We\u2019ll tell Dumbledore what really happened.\u201d \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry, Hagrid, we\u2019ll back you up,\u201d said Ron. Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid\u2019s beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug. \u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it. \u201cAr, maybe she\u2019s right,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair",
        "and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud splash. \u201cWhat\u2019s he done?\u201d said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard. \u201cStuck his head in the water barrel,\u201d said Hermione, putting the tankard away. Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes. \u201cTha\u2019s better,\u201d he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all. \u201cListen, it was good of yeh ter come an\u2019 see me, I really \u2014\u201d Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he\u2019d only just realized he was there. \u201cWHAT D\u2019YEH THINK YOU\u2019RE DOIN\u2019, EH?\u201d he roared, so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air. \u201cYEH\u2019RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN\u2019 AROUND AFTER DARK, HARRY! AN\u2019 YOU TWO! LETTIN\u2019 HIM!\u201d Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d Hagrid said angrily. \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019",
        "yer all back up ter school, an\u2019 don\u2019 let me catch yeh walkin\u2019 down ter seeme after dark again. I\u2019m not worth that!\u201d"

    "Chapter 7": [
        "The Boggart in the Wardrobe Malfoy didn\u2019t reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry\u2019s opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle. \u201cHow is it, Draco?\u201d simpered Pansy Parkinson. \u201cDoes it hurt much?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away. \u201cSettle down, settle down,\u201d said Professor Snape idly. Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn\u2019t have said \u201csettle down\u201d if they\u2019d walked in late, he\u2019d have given them detention. But Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape\u2019s classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above",
        "all others. They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table. \u201cSir,\u201d Malfoy called, \u201csir, I\u2019ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm \u2014\u201d\u201cWeasley, cut up Malfoy\u2019s roots for him,\u201d said Snape without looking up. Ron went brick red. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your arm,\u201d he hissed at Malfoy. Malfoy smirked across the table. \u201cWeasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.\u201d Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy\u2019s roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes. \u201cProfessor,\u201d drawled Malfoy, \u201cWeasley\u2019s mutilating my roots, sir.\u201d Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair. \u201cChange roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\u201d",
        "\u201cBut, sir \u2014 !\u201d Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces. \u201cNow,\u201d said Snape in his most dangerous voice. Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy, then took up the knife again. \u201cAnd, sir, I\u2019ll need this shrivelfig skinned,\u201d said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter. \u201cPotter, you can skin Malfoy\u2019s shrivelfig,\u201d said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him. Harry took Malfoy\u2019s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever. \u201cSeen your pal Hagrid lately?\u201d he asked them quietly. \u201cNone of your business,\u201d said Ron jerkily, without looking up. \u201cI\u2019m",
        "afraid he won\u2019t be a teacher much longer,\u201d said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. \u201cFather\u2019s not very happyabout my injury \u2014\u201d \u201cKeep talking, Malfoy, and I\u2019ll give you a real injury,\u201d snarled Ron. \u201c\u2014 he\u2019s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father\u2019s got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this\u201d \u2014 he gave a huge, fake sigh \u2014 \u201cwho knows if my arm\u2019ll ever be the same again?\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s why you\u2019re putting it on,\u201d said Harry, accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. \u201cTo try to get Hagrid fired.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, \u201cpartly, Potter. But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.\u201d A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst",
        "subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned \u2014 \u201cOrange, Longbottom,\u201d said Snape, ladling some up and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see. \u201cOrange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn\u2019t you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat spleen was needed? Didn\u2019t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?\u201d Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge of tears. \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cplease, I could help Neville put it right \u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,\u201d said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. \u201cLongbottom, at the end",
        "of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.\u201d Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear. \u201cHelp me!\u201d he moaned to Hermione.\u201cHey, Harry,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry\u2019s brass scales, \u201chave you heard? Daily Prophet this morning \u2014 they reckon Sirius Black\u2019s been sighted.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely. \u201cNot too far from here,\u201d said Seamus, who looked excited. \u201cIt was a Muggle who saw him. \u2019Course, she didn\u2019t really understand. The Muggles think he\u2019s just an ordinary criminal, don\u2019t they? So she phoned the telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.\u201d \u201cNot too far from here \u2026 ,\u201d Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry. He",
        "turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. \u201cWhat, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?\u201d But Malfoy\u2019s eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed on Harry. He leaned across the table. \u201cThinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry offhandedly. Malfoy\u2019s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile. \u201cOf course, if it was me,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI\u2019d have done something before now. I wouldn\u2019t be staying in school like a good boy, I\u2019d be out there looking for him.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about, Malfoy?\u201d said Ron roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t you know, Potter?\u201d breathed Malfoy, his pale eyes narrowed. \u201cKnow what?\u201d Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d rather not risk your neck,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I\u2019d want revenge. I\u2019d hunt him down myself.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said",
        "Harry angrily, but at that moment Snape called, \u201cYou should have finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it simmers and then we\u2019ll test Longbottom\u2019s. \u2026\u201dCrabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn\u2019t see. Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner. \u201cWhat did Malfoy mean?\u201d Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhy would I want revenge on Black? He hasn\u2019t done anything to me \u2014 yet.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s making it up,\u201d said Ron savagely. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make you do something stupid. \u2026\u201d The end of",
        "the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron. \u201cEveryone gather \u2019round,\u201d said Snape, his black eyes glittering, \u201cand watch what happens to Longbottom\u2019s toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don\u2019t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.\u201d The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville\u2019s potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops down Trevor\u2019s throat. There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape\u2019s palm. The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on",
        "top of Trevor, and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown. \u201cFive points from Gryffindor,\u201d said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face. \u201cI told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.\u201cFive points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right! Why didn\u2019t you lie, Hermione? You should\u2019ve said Neville did it all by himself!\u201d Hermione didn\u2019t answer. Ron looked around. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch. \u201cShe was right behind us,\u201d said Ron, frowning. Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared. \u201cThere she is,\u201d said Harry. Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying",
        "up the stairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione, joining them. \u201cOne minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs again.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Hermione looked slightly confused. \u201cOh \u2014 I had to go back for something. Oh no \u2014\u201d A seam had split on Hermione\u2019s bag. Harry wasn\u2019t surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books. \u201cWhy are you carrying all these around with you?\u201d Ron asked her. \u201cYou know how many subjects I\u2019m taking,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly. \u201cCouldn\u2019t hold these for me, could you?\u201d \u201cBut \u2014\u201d Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at the covers. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got any of these subjects today. It\u2019s",
        "only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same. \u201cI hope there\u2019s something good for lunch, I\u2019m starving,\u201d she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.\u201cD\u2019you get the feeling Hermione\u2019s not telling us something?\u201d Ron asked Harry. Professor Lupin wasn\u2019t there when they arrived at his first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher\u2019s desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you please put all your books back in your bags. Today\u2019s will be a practical lesson.",
        "You will need only your wands.\u201d A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books. They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before, unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose. \u201cRight then,\u201d said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. \u201cIf you\u2019d follow me.\u201d Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum. Peeves didn\u2019t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song. \u201cLoony, loopy Lupin,\u201d Peeves sang. \u201cLoony, loopy Lupin,",
        "loony, loopy Lupin \u2014\u201d Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still smiling.\u201cI\u2019d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cMr. Filch won\u2019t be able to get in to his brooms.\u201d Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin\u2019s words, except to blow a loud wet raspberry. Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand. \u201cThis is a useful little spell,\u201d he told the class over his shoulder. \u201cPlease watch closely.\u201d He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, \u201cWaddiwasi!\u201d and pointed it at Peeves. With the force of a bullet, the",
        "wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves\u2019s left nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing. \u201cCool, sir!\u201d said Dean Thomas in amazement. \u201cThank you, Dean,\u201d said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. \u201cShall we proceed?\u201d They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staffroom door. \u201cInside, please,\u201d said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back. The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape said, \u201cLeave it open, Lupin. I\u2019d rather",
        "not witness this.\u201d He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, \u201cPossibly no one\u2019s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise younot to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.\u201d Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers. Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows. \u201cI was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am sure he will perform it admirably.\u201d Neville\u2019s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape\u2019s lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap. \u201cNow, then,\u201d said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the",
        "end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall. \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm. \u201cThere\u2019s a boggart in there.\u201d Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. \u201cBoggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cWardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks \u2014 I\u2019ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice. \u201cSo, the first question we must",
        "ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?\u201d Hermione put up her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a shape-shifter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t have put it better myself,\u201d said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. \u201cSo the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does notyet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears. \u201cThis means,\u201d said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville\u2019s small sputter of terror, \u201cthat we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\u201d Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with",
        "her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go. \u201cEr \u2014 because there are so many of us, it won\u2019t know what shape it should be?\u201d \u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s always best to have company when you\u2019re dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake \u2014 tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening. \u201cThe charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing. \u201cWe will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please \u2026",
        "riddikulus!\u201d \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d said the class together. \u201cGood,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cVery good. But that was the easy part, I\u2019m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville.\u201d The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows. \u201cRight, Neville,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cFirst things first: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?\u201dNeville\u2019s lips moved, but no noise came out. \u201cDidn\u2019t catch that, Neville, sorry,\u201d said Professor Lupin cheerfully. Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, \u201cProfessor Snape.\u201d Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful. \u201cProfessor Snape \u2026 hmmm \u2026 Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?\u201d \u201cEr \u2014 yes,\u201d said Neville nervously. \u201cBut \u2014",
        "I don\u2019t want the boggart to turn into her either.\u201d \u201cNo, no, you misunderstand me,\u201d said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \u201cI wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?\u201d Neville looked startled, but said, \u201cWell \u2026 always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress \u2026 green, normally \u2026 and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.\u201d \u201cAnd a handbag?\u201d prompted Professor Lupin. \u201cA big red one,\u201d said Neville. \u201cRight then,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cCan you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind\u2019s eye?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was coming next. \u201cWhen the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAnd you will raise your wand \u2014 thus \u2014 and cry \u2018Riddikulus\u2019 \u2014 and concentrate hard on your",
        "grandmother\u2019s clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.\u201d There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more violently. \u201cIf Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cI would like all of you to take a moment now to think of thething that scares you most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical. \u2026\u201d The room went quiet. Harry thought \u2026 What scared him most in the world? His first thought was Lord Voldemort \u2014 a Voldemort returned to full strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind. \u2026 A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black",
        "cloak \u2026 a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth \u2026 then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning. \u2026 Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, \u201cTake its legs off.\u201d Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron\u2019s greatest fear was spiders. \u201cEveryone ready?\u201d said Professor Lupin. Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn\u2019t ready. How could you make a dementor less frightening? But he didn\u2019t want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves. \u201cNeville, we\u2019re going to back away,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cLet you have a clear field, all right? I\u2019ll call the next person forward. \u2026 Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot \u2014\u201d They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He",
        "looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready. \u201cOn the count of three, Neville,\u201d said Professor Lupin, who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. \u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 now!\u201d A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin\u2019s wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville. Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside hisrobes. \u201cR \u2014 r \u2014 riddikulus!\u201d squeaked Neville. There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag. There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and Professor",
        "Lupin shouted, \u201cParvati! Forward!\u201d Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising \u2014 \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d cried Parvati. A bandage unraveled at the mummy\u2019s feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off. \u201cSeamus!\u201d roared Professor Lupin. Seamus darted past Parvati. Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floor-length black hair and a skeletal, green-tinged face \u2014 a banshee. She opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry\u2019s head stand on end \u2014 \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d shouted Seamus. The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was gone. Crack! The banshee turned",
        "into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle, then \u2014 crack! \u2014 became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before \u2014 crack! \u2014 becoming a single, bloody eyeball. \u201cIt\u2019s confused!\u201d shouted Lupin. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there! Dean!\u201d Dean hurried forward. Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab. \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d yelled Dean.There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap. \u201cExcellent! Ron, you next!\u201d Ron leapt forward. Crack! Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then \u2014 \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d bellowed Ron, and the spider\u2019s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry\u2019s feet. He raised his",
        "wand, ready, but \u2014 \u201cHere!\u201d shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack! The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said, \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d almost lazily. Crack! \u201cForward, Neville, and finish him off!\u201d said Lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward looking determined. \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d he shouted, and they had a split second\u2019s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great \u201cHa!\u201d of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone. \u201cExcellent!\u201d cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause. \u201cExcellent, Neville. Well done, everyone. \u2026 Let me see \u2026 five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart \u2014",
        "ten for Neville because he did it twice \u2026 and five each to Hermione and Harry.\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,\u201d Lupin said lightly. \u201cVery well,everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me \u2026 to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\u201d Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn\u2019t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he\u2019d seen Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn\u2019t up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass out again? But no one else seemed to have noticed anything. \u201cDid you see me take that banshee?\u201d shouted Seamus. \u201cAnd the hand!\u201d said Dean, waving his own around. \u201cAnd Snape in that hat!\u201d \u201cAnd my",

    "Chapter 8": [
        "Flight of the Fat Lady In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people\u2019s favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin. \u201cLook at the state of his robes,\u201d Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. \u201cHe dresses like our old house-elf.\u201d But no one else cared that Professor Lupin\u2019s robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds. Harry only wished",
        "he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming Snape\u2019s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother\u2019s clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn\u2019t seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly atthe very mention of Professor Lupin\u2019s name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever. Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor Trelawney\u2019s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney\u2019s enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn\u2019t like Professor Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had",
        "taken to haunting Professor Trelawney\u2019s tower room at lunchtimes, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though they knew things the others didn\u2019t. They had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed. Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence. \u201cWhy would anyone bother looking after them?\u201d said Ron, after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms\u2019 slimy throats. At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver Wood,",
        "Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting one Thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season. There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of the fifty- foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and theSeeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker\u2019s team an extra one hundred and fifty points. Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as",
        "he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field. \u201cThis is our last chance \u2014 my last chance \u2014 to win the Quidditch Cup,\u201d he told them, striding up and down in front of them. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving at the end of this year. I\u2019ll never get another shot at it. \u201cGryffindor hasn\u2019t won for seven years now. Okay, so we\u2019ve had the worst luck in the world \u2014 injuries \u2014 then the tournament getting called off last year. \u2026\u201d Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat. \u201cBut we also know we\u2019ve got the best \u2014 ruddy \u2014 team \u2014 in \u2014 the \u2014 school,\u201d he said, punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic glint back in his eye. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three superb Chasers.\u201d Wood pointed at Alicia Spinnet, Angelina",
        "Johnson, and Katie Bell. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two unbeatable Beaters.\u201d \u201cStop it, Oliver, you\u2019re embarrassing us,\u201d said Fred and George Weasley together, pretending to blush. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!\u201d Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. \u201cAnd me,\u201d he added as an afterthought. \u201cWe think you\u2019re very good too, Oliver,\u201d said George. \u201cSpanking good Keeper,\u201d said Fred. \u201cThe point is,\u201d Wood went on, resuming his pacing, \u201cthe Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I\u2019ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven\u2019t got it, and this year\u2019s the last chance we\u2019ll get to finally see our name on the thing. \u2026\u201dWood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic. \u201cOliver, this year\u2019s our year,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it, Oliver!\u201d",
        "said Angelina. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Harry. Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry\u2019s wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup. Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training, cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing excitedly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy. \u201cFirst Hogsmeade weekend,\u201d said Ron, pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board. \u201cEnd of October. Halloween.\u201d \u201cExcellent,\u201d said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait hole. \u201cI need to visit Zonko\u2019s. I\u2019m nearly out of Stink Pellets.\u201d Harry threw himself into",
        "a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his mind. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to go next time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re bound to catch Black soon. He\u2019s been sighted once already\u201d \u201cBlack\u2019s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAsk McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages \u2014\u201d \u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHarry\u2019s supposed to stay in school \u2014\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t be the only third year left behind,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAsk McGonagall, go on, Harry \u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, I think I will,\u201d said Harry, making up his mind. Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A large,dead spider was dangling from his mouth. \u201cDoes he have to eat that in front of us?\u201d said Ron, scowling. \u201cClever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by",
        "yourself?\u201d said Hermione. Crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed insolently on Ron. \u201cJust keep him over there, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart. \u201cI\u2019ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.\u201d Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work. \u201cYou can copy mine, if you like,\u201d said Ron, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry. Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn\u2019t say anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced. \u201cOY!\u201d Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. \u201cGET OFF, YOU STUPID",
        "ANIMAL!\u201d Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing. \u201cRon, don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d squealed Hermione; the whole common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top \u2014 \u201cCATCH THAT CAT!\u201d Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers. George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs, and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail. \u201cLook",
        "at him!\u201d he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front of her. \u201cHe\u2019s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!\u201d \u201cCrookshanks doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s wrong!\u201d said Hermione, her voice shaking. \u201cAll cats chase rats, Ron!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something funny about that animal!\u201d said Ron, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. \u201cIt heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!\u201d \u201cOh, what rubbish,\u201d said Hermione impatiently. \u201cCrookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d\u2019you think \u2014\u201d \u201cThat cat\u2019s got it in for Scabbers!\u201d said Ron, ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle. \u201cAnd Scabbers was here first, and he\u2019s ill!\u201d Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys\u2019 dormitories. Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even",
        "though he, Harry, and Hermione were working together on the same puffapod. \u201cHow\u2019s Scabbers?\u201d Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail. \u201cHe\u2019s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,\u201d said Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor. \u201cCareful, Weasley, careful!\u201d cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes. They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest, joined the lineoutside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at the front of the line. Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were",
        "looking very serious. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Lavender?\u201d said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the group. \u201cShe got a letter from home this morning,\u201d Parvati whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s her rabbit, Binky. He\u2019s been killed by a fox.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lavender.\u201d \u201cI should have known!\u201d said Lavender tragically. \u201cYou know what day it is?\u201d \u201cEr \u2014\u201d \u201cThe sixteenth of October! \u2018That thing you\u2019re dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of October!\u2019 Remember? She was right, she was right!\u201d The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, \u201cYou \u2014 you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?\u201d \u201cWell, not necessarily by a fox,\u201d said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, \u201cbut I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Hermione. She paused again. Then \u2014 \u201cWas Binky an old rabbit?\u201d",
        "\u201cN \u2014 no!\u201d sobbed Lavender. \u201cH \u2014 he was only a baby!\u201d Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBut then, why would you dread him dying?\u201d said Hermione. Parvati glared at her. \u201cWell, look at it logically,\u201d said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. \u201cI mean, Binky didn\u2019t even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today \u2014\u201d Lavender wailed loudly. \u201c\u2014 and she can\u2019t have been dreading it, because it\u2019s come as a real shock \u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind Hermione, Lavender,\u201d said Ron loudly, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t think other people\u2019s pets matter very much.\u201d Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn\u2019t talk to each other for the whole class. Harry still hadn\u2019t decided what he was",
        "going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first. \u201cOne moment, please!\u201d she called as the class made to leave. \u201cAs you\u2019re all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don\u2019t forget!\u201d Neville put up his hand. \u201cPlease, Professor, I \u2014 I think I\u2019ve lost \u2014\u201d \u201cYour grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cShe seemed to think it was safer. Well, that\u2019s all, you may leave.\u201d \u201cAsk her now,\u201d Ron hissed at Harry. \u201cOh, but \u2014\u201d Hermione began. \u201cGo for it, Harry,\u201d said Ron stubbornly. Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall\u2019s desk. \u201cYes, Potter?\u201d Harry took a deep breath. \u201cProfessor, my aunt and uncle",
        "\u2014 er \u2014 forgot to sign my form,\u201d he said. Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cSo \u2014 er \u2014 d\u2019you think it would be all right \u2014 I mean, will it be okay if I \u2014 if I go to Hogsmeade?\u201d Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Potter,\u201d she said. \u201cYou heard what I said. No form, no visiting the village. That\u2019s the rule.\u201d\u201cBut \u2014 Professor, my aunt and uncle \u2014 you know, they\u2019re Muggles, they don\u2019t really understand about \u2014 about Hogwarts forms and stuff,\u201d Harry said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. \u201cIf you said I could go \u2014\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t say so,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer. \u201cThe form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission.\u201d She",
        "turned to look at him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Potter, but that\u2019s my final word. You had better hurry, or you\u2019ll be late for your next lesson.\u201d There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an \u201call-for-the-best\u201d expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade. \u201cThere\u2019s always the feast,\u201d said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry up. \u201cYou know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry gloomily, \u201cgreat.\u201d The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said made him feel any better",
        "about being left behind. Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon\u2019s signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn\u2019t had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort. \u201cThey make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cAll right, the sweetshop\u2019s rather good, and Zonko\u2019s Joke Shop\u2019s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack\u2019salways worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you\u2019re not missing anything.\u201d On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best",
        "to act normally. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,\u201d said Hermione, looking desperately sorry for him. \u201cYeah, loads,\u201d said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry\u2019s difficulties. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d said Harry, in what he hoped was an offhand voice, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.\u201d He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn\u2019t be going. \u201cStaying here, Potter?\u201d shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle. \u201cScared of passing the dementors?\u201d Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower. \u201cPassword?\u201d said the Fat Lady,",
        "jerking out of a doze. \u201cFortuna Major,\u201d said Harry listlessly. The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off. \u201cHarry! Harry! Hi, Harry!\u201d It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey\u201d \u2014 Colin looked eagerly around at his friends \u2014 \u201cyou cancome and sit with us, if you like, Harry!\u201d \u201cEr \u2014 no, thanks, Colin,\u201d said Harry, who wasn\u2019t in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. \u201cI \u2014 I\u2019ve got to go to the library, got to get some work done.\u201d After that, he had",
        "no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again. \u201cWhat was the point waking me up?\u201d the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked away. Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn\u2019t feel like working. He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Filch snarled suspiciously. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry truthfully. \u201cNothing!\u201d spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. \u201cA likely story! Sneaking around on your own \u2014 why aren\u2019t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends?\u201d Harry shrugged. \u201cWell, get back to your common room where you belong!\u201d snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight. But Harry didn\u2019t go",
        "back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, \u201cHarry?\u201d Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office door. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said Lupin, though in a very different voice from Filch. \u201cWhere are Ron and Hermione?\u201d \u201cHogsmeade,\u201d said Harry, in a would-be casual voice. \u201cAh,\u201d said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in? I\u2019ve just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.\u201d\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry. He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers. \u201cWater demon,\u201d said Lupin,",
        "surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.\u201d The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner. \u201cCup of tea?\u201d Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. \u201cI was just thinking of making one.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Harry awkwardly. Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout. \u201cSit down,\u201d said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. \u201cI\u2019ve only got teabags, I\u2019m afraid \u2014 but I daresay you\u2019ve had enough of tea leaves?\u201d Harry looked at him. Lupin\u2019s eyes were twinkling. \u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me,\u201d said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea. \u201cYou\u2019re not worried, are you?\u201d",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he\u2019d seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn\u2019t want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think he couldn\u2019t cope with a boggart. Something of Harry\u2019s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because Lupin said, \u201cAnything worrying you, Harry?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him. \u201cYes,\u201d he said suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin\u2019s desk. \u201cYou know that day we fought the boggart?\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin slowly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let me fight it?\u201d said Harry abruptly. Lupin raised his eyebrows. \u201cI would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\u201d he said, sounding surprised. Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he\u2019d done any such thing, was taken aback. \u201cWhy?\u201d he said again.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said Lupin, frowning slightly, \u201cI assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.\u201d Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he\u2019d expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort\u2019s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore. \u201cClearly, I was wrong,\u201d said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think of Voldemort,\u201d said Harry honestly. \u201cI \u2014 I remembered those dementors.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Lupin thoughtfully. \u201cWell, well \u2026 I\u2019m impressed.\u201d He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cThat suggests that what you fear most of all is \u2014 fear. Very wise, Harry.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so he drank some more",
        "tea. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been thinking that I didn\u2019t believe you capable of fighting the boggart?\u201d said Lupin shrewdly. \u201cWell \u2026 yeah,\u201d said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier. \u201cProfessor Lupin, you know the dementors \u2014\u201d He was interrupted by a knock on the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d called Lupin. The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing.\u201cAh, Severus,\u201d said Lupin, smiling. \u201cThanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?\u201d Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin. \u201cI was just showing Harry my grindylow,\u201d said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank. \u201cFascinating,\u201d said Snape, without looking at it. \u201cYou should drink that directly, Lupin.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I will,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI made an entire cauldronful,\u201d Snape continued. \u201cIf you need",
        "more.\u201d \u201cI should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn\u2019t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. \u201cProfessor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.\u201d He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \u201cPity sugar makes it useless,\u201d he added, taking a sip and shuddering. \u201cWhy \u2014 ?\u201d Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling a bit off-color,\u201d he said. \u201cThis potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren\u2019t many wizards who are up to making it.\u201d Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a",
        "crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands. \u201cProfessor Snape\u2019s very interested in the Dark Arts,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cReally?\u201d said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion. \u201cSome people reckon \u2014\u201d Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, \u201csome people reckon he\u2019d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.\u201dLupin drained the goblet and pulled a face. \u201cDisgusting,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, Harry, I\u2019d better get back to work. I\u2019ll see you at the feast later.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, putting down his empty teacup. The empty goblet was still smoking. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe got as much as we could carry.\u201d A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry\u2019s lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they\u2019d had the time",
        "of their lives. \u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps. \u201cWhat\u2019s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?\u201d By the sound of it \u2014 everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko\u2019s Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides. \u201cThe post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!\u201d \u201cHoneydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there\u2019s a bit, look \u2014\u201d \u201cWe think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks \u2014\u201d \u201cWish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up \u2014\u201d \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d said Hermione, looking anxious. \u201cDid you get any work done?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLupin made me a cup of tea",
        "in his office. And then Snape came in. \u2026\u201d He told them all about the goblet. Ron\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cLupin drank it?\u201d he gasped. \u201cIs he mad?\u201d Hermione checked her watch. \u201cWe\u2019d better go down, you know, the feast\u2019ll be starting in five minutes. \u2026\u201d They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape.\u201cBut if he \u2014 you know\u201d \u2014 Hermione dropped her voice, glancing nervously around \u2014 \u201cif he was trying to \u2014 to poison Lupin \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t have done it in front of Harry.\u201d \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes. The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who",
        "were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape\u2019s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural? The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading. It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry\u2019s good mood couldn\u2019t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, \u201cThe dementors send their love, Potter!\u201d Harry,",
        "Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone going in?\u201d said Ron curiously. Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed. \u201cLet me through, please,\u201d came Percy\u2019s voice, and he came bustling importantly through the crowd. \u201cWhat\u2019s theholdup here? You can\u2019t all have forgotten the password \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m Head Boy \u2014\u201d And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, \u201cSomebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.\u201d People\u2019s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Ginny, who had just arrived. A moment",
        "later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was. \u201cOh, my \u2014\u201d Hermione grabbed Harry\u2019s arm. The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely. Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying toward him. \u201cWe need to find her,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cProfessor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky!\u201d said a cackling voice. It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or",
        "worry. \u201cWhat do you mean, Peeves?\u201d said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves\u2019s grin faded a little. He didn\u2019t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle. \u201cAshamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn\u2019t want to be seen. She\u2019s a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful,\u201d he said happily. \u201cPoor thing,\u201d he added unconvincingly. \u201cDid she say who did it?\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\u201cOh yes, Professorhead,\u201d said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. \u201cHe got very angry when she wouldn\u2019t let him in, you see.\u201d Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from between his own legs. \u201cNasty temper he\u2019s got, that Sirius Black.\u201d"

    "Chapter 9": [
        "Grim Defeat Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall, where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused. \u201cThe teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,\u201d Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that, for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,\u201d he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. \u201cSend word with one of the ghosts.\u201d Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, \u201cOh, yes, you\u2019ll be needing \u2026\u201d One casual wave of his wand and the",
        "long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags. \u201cSleep well,\u201d said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him. The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had justhappened. \u201cEveryone into their sleeping bags!\u201d shouted Percy. \u201cCome on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner. \u201cDo you think Black\u2019s still in the castle?\u201d Hermione whispered anxiously. \u201cDumbledore obviously thinks he might be,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,\u201d said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk. \u201cThe one night we weren\u2019t in the tower. \u2026\u201d \u201cI",
        "reckon he\u2019s lost track of time, being on the run,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he\u2019d have come bursting in here.\u201d Hermione shuddered. All around them, people were asking one another the same question: \u201cHow did he get in?\u201d \u201cMaybe he knows how to Apparate,\u201d said a Ravenclaw a few feet away. \u201cJust appear out of thin air, you know.\u201d \u201cDisguised himself, probably,\u201d said a Hufflepuff fifth year. \u201cHe could\u2019ve flown in,\u201d suggested Dean Thomas. \u201cHonestly, am I the only person who\u2019s ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?\u201d said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron. \u201cProbably,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause the castle\u2019s protected by more than walls, you know,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThere are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can\u2019t just Apparate in here. And I\u2019d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They\u2019re guarding every",
        "single entrance to the grounds. They\u2019d have seen him fly in too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they\u2019ll have them covered. \u2026\u201d \u201cThe lights are going out now!\u201d Percy shouted. \u201cI want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!\u201dThe candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind. Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags,",
        "telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore\u2019s footsteps drew nearer. \u201cAny sign of him, Professor?\u201d asked Percy in a whisper. \u201cNo. All well here?\u201d \u201cEverything under control, sir.\u201d \u201cGood. There\u2019s no point moving them all now. I\u2019ve found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You\u2019ll be able to move them back in tomorrow.\u201d \u201cAnd the Fat Lady, sir?\u201d \u201cHiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She\u2019s still very distressed, but once she\u2019s calmed down, I\u2019ll have Mr. Filch restore her.\u201d Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps. \u201cHeadmaster?\u201d It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. \u201cThe whole of the third floor has been searched. He\u2019s not",
        "there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.\u201d \u201cWhat about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney\u2019s room? The Owlery?\u201d \u201cAll searched \u2026\u201d \u201cVery well, Severus. I didn\u2019t really expect Black to linger.\u201d\u201cHave you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?\u201d asked Snape. Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear. \u201cMany, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.\u201d Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore\u2019s back was to him, but he could see Percy\u2019s face, rapt with attention, and Snape\u2019s profile, which looked angry. \u201cYou remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before \u2014 ah \u2014 the start of term?\u201d said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation. \u201cI do, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice.",
        "\u201cIt seems \u2014 almost impossible \u2014 that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns when you appointed \u2014\u201d \u201cI do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,\u201d said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn\u2019t reply. \u201cI must go down to the dementors,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI said I would inform them when our search was complete.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t they want to help, sir?\u201d said Percy. \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore coldly. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.\u201d Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left. Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of",
        "them had their eyes open too, reflecting the starry ceiling. \u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Ron mouthed.The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who\u2019d listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub. The Fat Lady\u2019s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords, which he changed at least twice a day. \u201cHe\u2019s a complete lunatic,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. \u201cCan\u2019t we get anyone else?\u201d \u201cNone of the other pictures wanted the job,\u201d said Percy. \u201cFrightened of what happened",
        "to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.\u201d Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry\u2019s worries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother\u2019s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died. \u201cThere\u2019s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,\u201d she said in a very serious voice. \u201cI know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black \u2014\u201d \u201cI know he\u2019s after me,\u201d said Harry wearily. \u201cI heard Ron\u2019s dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.\u201d Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a moment",
        "or two, then said, \u201cI see! Well, in that case, Potter, you\u2019ll understand why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, it\u2019s very exposed, Potter \u2014\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got our first match on Saturday!\u201d said Harry, outraged. \u201cI\u2019ve got to train, Professor!\u201d Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team\u2019s prospects; it had been she, after all, who\u2019d suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited, holding his breath. \u201cHmm \u2026\u201d Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. \u201cWell \u2026 goodness knows, I\u2019d like to see us win the Cup at last \u2026 but all the same, Potter \u2026 I\u2019d be happier if a teacher were present. I\u2019ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee",
        "your training sessions.\u201d The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before Saturday\u2019s match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news. \u201cWe\u2019re not playing Slytherin!\u201d he told them, looking very angry. \u201cFlint\u2019s just been to see me. We\u2019re playing Hufflepuff instead.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d chorused the rest of the team. \u201cFlint\u2019s excuse is that their Seeker\u2019s arm\u2019s still injured,\u201d said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. \u201cBut it\u2019s obvious why they\u2019re doing it. Don\u2019t want to play in this weather. Think it\u2019ll damage their chances. \u2026\u201d There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of thunder. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Malfoy\u2019s arm!\u201d said Harry furiously. \u201cHe\u2019s faking it!\u201d \u201cI know that, but we can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said",
        "Wood bitterly. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been practicing all those moves assuming we\u2019re playing Slytherin, and instead it\u2019s Hufflepuff, and their style\u2019s quite different. They\u2019ve got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory \u2014\u201d Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.\u201cWhat?\u201d said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior. \u201cHe\u2019s that tall, good-looking one, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Angelina. \u201cStrong and silent,\u201d said Katie, and they started to giggle again. \u201cHe\u2019s only silent because he\u2019s too thick to string two words together,\u201d said Fred impatiently. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?\u201d \u201cWe were playing in completely different conditions!\u201d Wood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly. \u201cDiggory\u2019s put a very strong side together! He\u2019s an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you\u2019d take it like this! We mustn\u2019t relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot",
        "us! We must win!\u201d \u201cOliver, calm down!\u201d said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. \u201cWe\u2019re taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.\u201d The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy. \u201cAh, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!\u201d he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows. Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, \u201cDiggory\u2019s got",
        "a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him \u2014\u201d Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, Professor Lupin, I \u2014\u201d But it wasn\u2019t Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher\u2019s desk; it was Snape. \u201cThis lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we\u2019ll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.\u201d But Harry didn\u2019t move. \u201cWhere\u2019s Professor Lupin?\u201d he said. \u201cHe says he is feeling too ill to teach today,\u201d said Snape with a twisted smile. \u201cI believe I told you to sit down?\u201d But Harry stayed where he was. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Snape\u2019s black eyes glittered. \u201cNothing life-threatening,\u201d he said, looking as though he wished it were. \u201cFive more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again,",
        "it will be fifty.\u201d Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class. \u201cAs I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far \u2014\u201d \u201cPlease, sir, we\u2019ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,\u201d said Hermione quickly, \u201cand we\u2019re just about to start \u2014\u201d \u201cBe quiet,\u201d said Snape coldly. \u201cI did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin\u2019s lack of organization.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever. \u201cYou are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you \u2014 I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss \u2014\u201d Harry watched",
        "him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know they hadn\u2019t covered. \u201c\u2014 werewolves,\u201d said Snape.\u201cBut, sir,\u201d said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, \u201cwe\u2019re not supposed to do werewolves yet, we\u2019re due to start hinkypunks \u2014\u201d \u201cMiss Granger,\u201d said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, \u201cI was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.\u201d He glanced around again. \u201cAll of you! Now!\u201d With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class opened their books. \u201cWhich of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?\u201d said Snape. Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air. \u201cAnyone?\u201d Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. \u201cAre you telling",
        "me that Professor Lupin hasn\u2019t even taught you the basic distinction between \u2014\u201d \u201cWe told you,\u201d said Parvati suddenly, \u201cwe haven\u2019t got as far as werewolves yet, we\u2019re still on \u2014\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d snarled Snape. \u201cWell, well, well, I never thought I\u2019d meet a third-year class who wouldn\u2019t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are. \u2026\u201d \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, \u201cthe werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf \u2014\u201d \u201cThat is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,\u201d said Snape coolly. \u201cFive more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.\u201d Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how",
        "much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \u201cYouasked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don\u2019t want to be told?\u201d The class knew instantly he\u2019d gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath. \u201cDetention, Weasley,\u201d Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron\u2019s. \u201cAnd if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.\u201d No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin.",
        "\u201cVery poorly explained \u2026 That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia. \u2026 Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn\u2019t have given it three. \u2026\u201d When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back. \u201cYou will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.\u201d Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape. \u201cSnape\u2019s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\u201d Harry said to",
        "Hermione. \u201cWhy\u2019s he got it in for Lupin? D\u2019you think this is all because of the boggart?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione pensively. \u201cBut I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. \u2026\u201d Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage. \u201cD\u2019you know what that \u2014\u201d (he called Snape something that made Hermione say \u201cRon!\u201d) \u201c\u2014 is making me do? I\u2019ve got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic!\u201d He was breathing deeply, his fists clenched. \u201cWhycouldn\u2019t Black have hidden in Snape\u2019s office, eh? He could have finished him off for us!\u201d Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was still dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright \u2014 Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating",
        "next to him, blowing hard in his ear. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling. Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory. As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He",
        "bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside. \u201cYou know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\u201d Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. \u201cThere are plenty of mice around this place \u2014 go and chase them. Go on,\u201d he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot. \u201cLeave Scabbers alone.\u201d The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren\u2019t called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lotbigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory\u2019s weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course. Harry whiled",
        "away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys\u2019 staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone. \u201cStand and fight, you mangy cur!\u201d yelled Sir Cadogan. \u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Harry yawned. He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he\u2019d started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough one,\u201d said Wood, who wasn\u2019t eating anything. \u201cStop worrying, Oliver,\u201d said Alicia soothingly, \u201cwe don\u2019t mind a bit of rain.\u201d But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads",
        "bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium. The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood\u2019s usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn\u2019t come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him. The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn\u2019t hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry\u2019s glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field, wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked",
        "up to each other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch\u2019s mouth form the words, \u201cMount your brooms.\u201d He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant \u2014 they were off. Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain. Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the",
        "game. He couldn\u2019t hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn\u2019t seen them coming. He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart. \u2026 With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud. \u201cI called for",
        "time-out!\u201d Wood roared at his team. \u201cCome on, under here \u2014\u201d They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped themhurriedly on his robes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the score?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re fifty points up,\u201d said Wood, \u201cbut unless we get the Snitch soon, we\u2019ll be playing into the night.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got no chance with these on,\u201d Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses. At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming. \u201cI\u2019ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\u201d He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, \u201cImpervius!\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d she said, handing them back to Harry. \u201cThey\u2019ll repel water!\u201d Wood looked as though he could have kissed her. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared",
        "into the crowd. \u201cOkay, team, let\u2019s go for it!\u201d Hermione\u2019s spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he\u2019d ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction. \u2026 There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly \u2014 He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him completely \u2014 the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats. Harry\u2019s numb hands slipped",
        "on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished.\u201cHarry!\u201d came Wood\u2019s anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts. \u201cHarry, behind you!\u201d Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them \u2014 With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broom- handle and zoomed toward the Snitch. \u201cCome on!\u201d he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face. \u201cFaster!\u201d But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf \u2014 what was going on? And then a horribly familiar",
        "wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of something moving on the field below. \u2026 Before he\u2019d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down. At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. \u2026 Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head \u2026 a woman \u2026 \u201cNot Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\u201d \u201cStand aside, you silly girl \u2026 stand aside, now. \u2026\u201d \u201cNot Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead \u2014\u201d Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry\u2019s brain. \u2026 What was he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her. \u2026 She was going to die. \u2026 She was going to be murdered. \u2026",
        "He was falling, falling through the icy mist. \u201cNot Harry! Please \u2026 have mercy \u2026 have mercy. \u2026\u201d A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no more. \u201cLucky the ground was so soft.\u201d\u201cI thought he was dead for sure.\u201d \u201cBut he didn\u2019t even break his glasses.\u201d Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn\u2019t have a clue where he was, or how he\u2019d got there, or what he\u2019d been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten. \u201cThat was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d Scariest \u2026 the scariest thing \u2026 hooded black figures \u2026 cold \u2026 screaming \u2026 Harry\u2019s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was",
        "gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they\u2019d just climbed out of a swimming pool. \u201cHarry!\u201d said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath the mud. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d It was as though Harry\u2019s memory was on fast forward. The lightning \u2014 the Grim \u2014 the Snitch \u2014 and the dementors \u2026 \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped. \u201cYou fell off,\u201d said Fred. \u201cMust\u2019ve been \u2014 what \u2014 fifty feet?\u201d \u201cWe thought you\u2019d died,\u201d said Alicia, who was shaking. Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot. \u201cBut the match,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat happened? Are we doing a replay?\u201d No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t \u2014 lose?\u201d \u201cDiggory got the Snitch,\u201d said George. \u201cJust after you fell. He didn\u2019t realize what had happened. When he looked back and",
        "saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square \u2026 even Wood admits it.\u201d\u201cWhere is Wood?\u201d said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn\u2019t there. \u201cStill in the showers,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe think he\u2019s trying to drown himself.\u201d Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly. \u201cC\u2019mon, Harry, you\u2019ve never missed the Snitch before.\u201d \u201cThere had to be one time you didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said George. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe lost by a hundred points, right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin \u2026\u201d \u201cHufflepuff\u2019ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\u201d said George. \u201cBut if they beat Ravenclaw \u2026\u201d \u201cNo way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff \u2026\u201d \u201cIt all depends on the points",
        "\u2014 a margin of a hundred either way \u2014\u201d Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost \u2026 for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match. After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and see you later,\u201d Fred told him. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, Harry, you\u2019re still the best Seeker we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry\u2019s bed. \u201cDumbledore was really angry,\u201d Hermione said in a quaking voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left",
        "the stadium right away. \u2026 He was furious they\u2019d come onto the grounds. We heard him \u2014\u201d \u201cThen he magicked you onto a stretcher,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyonethought you were \u2026\u201d His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him \u2026 about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say. \u201cDid someone get my Nimbus?\u201d Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other. \u201cEr \u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, looking from one to the other. \u201cWell \u2026 when you fell off, it got blown away,\u201d said Hermione hesitantly. \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cAnd it hit \u2014 it hit \u2014 oh, Harry \u2014 it hit the Whomping Willow.\u201d Harry\u2019s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree",
        "that stood alone in the middle of the grounds. \u201cAnd?\u201d he said, dreading the answer. \u201cWell, you know the Whomping Willow,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt \u2014 it doesn\u2019t like being hit.\u201d \u201cProfessor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around,\u201d said Hermione in a very small voice. Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry\u2019s faithful, finally beaten broomstick."

    "Chapter 10": [
        "The Marauder\u2019s Map Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn\u2019t argue or complain, but he wouldn\u2019t let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn\u2019t help it; he felt as though he\u2019d lost one of his best friends. He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn\u2019t blame him in",
        "the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry\u2019s bedside only at night. But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him. He hadn\u2019t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he hadnearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast? And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed",
        "every time they went near one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents. Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother\u2019s life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort\u2019s laughter before he murdered her. \u2026 Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother\u2019s voice. It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, even if he had to endure Draco Malfoy\u2019s taunting. Malfoy",
        "was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor\u2019s defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor. \u201cIf Snape\u2019s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I\u2019m skiving off,\u201d said Ron as they headed toward Lupin\u2019s classroom after lunch. \u201cCheck who\u2019s in there, Hermione.\u201d Hermione peered around the classroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dProfessor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as",
        "they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape\u2019s behavior while Lupin had been ill. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about werewolves \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 two rolls of parchment!\u201d \u201cDid you tell Professor Snape we haven\u2019t covered them yet?\u201d Lupin asked, frowning slightly. The babble broke out again. \u201cYes, but he said we were really behind \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 he wouldn\u2019t listen \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 two rolls of parchment!\u201d Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll speak to Professor Snape. You don\u2019t have to do the essay.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ve already finished it!\u201d They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made",
        "of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless-looking. \u201cLures travelers into bogs,\u201d said Professor Lupin as they took notes. \u201cYou notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead \u2014 people follow the light \u2014 then \u2014\u201d The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass. When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but \u2014 \u201cWait a moment, Harry,\u201d Lupin called. \u201cI\u2019d like a word.\u201d Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk\u2019s box with a cloth.\u201cI heard about the match,\u201d said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe tree smashed it to bits.\u201d Lupin sighed. \u201cThey planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play",
        "a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance. \u201cDid you hear about the dementors too?\u201d said Harry with difficulty. Lupin looked at him quickly. \u201cYes, I did. I don\u2019t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time \u2026 furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds. \u2026 I suppose they were the reason you fell?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself. \u201cWhy? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cIt has nothing to do with weakness,\u201d said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry\u2019s mind. \u201cThe dementors",
        "affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don\u2019t have.\u201d A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin\u2019s gray hairs and the lines on his young face. \u201cDementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can\u2019t see them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself \u2026 soul-less and evil. You\u2019ll be left with nothing but the worstexperiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.",
        "You have nothing to feel ashamed of.\u201d \u201cWhen they get near me \u2014\u201d Harry stared at Lupin\u2019s desk, his throat tight. \u201cI can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\u201d Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry\u2019s shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment\u2019s silence, then \u2014 \u201cWhy did they have to come to the match?\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cThey\u2019re getting hungry,\u201d said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. \u201cDumbledore won\u2019t let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up. \u2026 I don\u2019t think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement \u2026 emotions running high \u2026 it was their idea of a feast.\u201d \u201cAzkaban must be terrible,\u201d Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly. \u201cThe fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don\u2019t need walls and",
        "water to keep the prisoners in, not when they\u2019re all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheerful thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.\u201d \u201cBut Sirius Black escaped from them,\u201d Harry said slowly. \u201cHe got away. \u2026\u201d Lupin\u2019s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, straightening up, \u201cBlack must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it possible. \u2026 Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long. \u2026\u201d \u201cYou made that dementor on the train back off,\u201d said Harry suddenly. \u201cThere are \u2014 certain defenses one can use,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.\u201d\u201cWhat defenses?\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cCan you teach me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to",

I\u2019ll try and help. But it\u2019ll have to wait until next term, I\u2019m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill.\u201d What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother\u2019s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry\u2019s mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard",
        "as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore\u2019s anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances. Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn\u2019t stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn\u2019t fooled; they were doing it to keep",
        "him company, and he was very grateful.To everyone\u2019s delight except Harry\u2019s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term. \u201cWe can do all our Christmas shopping there!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!\u201d Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own. On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow",
        "had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still and quiet. \u201cPsst \u2014 Harry!\u201d He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said Harry curiously. \u201cHow come you\u2019re not going to Hogsmeade?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,\u201d said Fred, with a mysterious wink. \u201cCome in here. \u2026\u201d He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry. \u201cEarly Christmas present for you, Harry,\u201d he said. Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing",
        "written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George\u2019s jokes, stared at it.\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to be?\u201d \u201cThis, Harry, is the secret of our success,\u201d said George, patting the parchment fondly. \u201cIt\u2019s a wrench, giving it to you,\u201d said Fred, \u201cbut we decided last night, your need\u2019s greater than ours.\u201d \u201cAnyway, we know it by heart,\u201d said George. \u201cWe bequeath it to you. We don\u2019t really need it anymore.\u201d \u201cAnd what do I need with a bit of old parchment?\u201d said Harry. \u201cA bit of old parchment!\u201d said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. \u201cExplain, George.\u201d \u201cWell \u2026 when we were in our first year, Harry \u2014 young, carefree, and innocent \u2014\u201d Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent. \u201c\u2014 well, more innocent than we are now \u2014 we got into a spot of bother with",
        "Filch.\u201d \u201cWe let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason \u2014\u201d \u201cSo he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 detention \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 disembowelment \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 and we couldn\u2019t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2014\u201d said Harry, starting to grin. \u201cWell, what would you\u2019ve done?\u201d said Fred. \u201cGeorge caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed \u2014 this.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds, you know,\u201d said George. \u201cWe don\u2019t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn\u2019t have confiscated it.\u201d \u201cAnd you know how to work it?\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Fred, smirking. \u201cThis little beauty\u2019s taught us more than all the teachers in this",
        "school.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re winding me up,\u201d said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of parchment. \u201cOh, are we?\u201d said George. He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, \u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\u201d And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider\u2019s web from the point that George\u2019s wand had touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed: Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE MARAUDER\u2019S MAP It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot",
        "in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker\u2019s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry\u2019s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else. This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead \u2014 \u201cRight into Hogsmeade,\u201d said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \u201cThere are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\u201d \u2014 he pointed them out \u2014 \u201cbut we\u2019re sure we\u2019re the only ones who know about these. Don\u2019t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it\u2019s caved in \u2014 completely blocked. And we don\u2019t reckon anyone\u2019s ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow\u2019s planted right over the",
        "entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar ofHoneydukes. We\u2019ve used it loads of times. And as you might\u2019ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone\u2019s hump.\u201d \u201cMoony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\u201d sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \u201cWe owe them so much.\u201d \u201cNoble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of law-breakers,\u201d said Fred solemnly. \u201cRight,\u201d said George briskly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wipe it after you\u2019ve used it \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 or anyone can read it,\u201d Fred said warningly. \u201cJust tap it again and say, \u2018Mischief managed!\u2019 And it\u2019ll go blank.\u201d \u201cSo, young Harry,\u201d said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \u201cmind you behave yourself.\u201d \u201cSee you in Honeydukes,\u201d said George, winking. They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way. Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny",
        "ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn\u2019t know \u2026 he wouldn\u2019t have to pass the dementors at all. \u2026 But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory. Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can\u2019t see where it keeps its brain. This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against. \u2026 Aids for Magical Mischief-Makers \u2026 but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn\u2019t as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone \u2026 and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening. \u2026 Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger. Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders,",
        "he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried tothe door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch. What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor. Harry watched carefully. His little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, \u201cDissendium.\u201d \u201cDissendium!\u201d Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.",
        "At once, the statue\u2019s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward. He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \u201cLumos!\u201d and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \u201cMischief managed!\u201d The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off. The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then",
        "on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him. It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet. \u2026 Then, without warning, his head hit something hard. It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn\u2019t hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge. He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry climbed",
        "out of the trapdoor and replaced it \u2014 it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door. Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs. \u201cAnd get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they\u2019ve nearly cleaned us out \u2014\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice. A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another chance \u2014 Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs;",
        "looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes \u2014 he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up. Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined thelook that would spread over Dudley\u2019s piggy face if he could see where Harry was now. There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent- looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were \u201cSpecial",
        "Effects\u201d sweets: Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\u201cbreathe fire for your friends!\u201d), Ice Mice (\u201chear your teeth chatter and squeak!\u201d), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\u201chop realistically in the stomach!\u201d), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons. Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them. \u201cUgh, no, Harry won\u2019t want one of those, they\u2019re for vampires, I expect,\u201d Hermione was saying. \u201cHow about these?\u201d said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione\u2019s nose. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d said Harry. Ron nearly dropped the jar. \u201cHarry!\u201d squealed Hermione. \u201cWhat are you doing here? How \u2014 how did you",
        "\u2014 ?\u201d \u201cWow!\u201d said Ron, looking very impressed, \u201cyou\u2019ve learned to Apparate!\u201d \u201c \u2019Course I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder\u2019s Map. \u201cHow come Fred and George never gave it to me!\u201d said Ron, outraged. \u201cI\u2019m their brother!\u201d\u201cBut Harry isn\u2019t going to keep it!\u201d said Hermione, as though the idea were ludicrous. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d said Harry. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \u201cHand in something that good?\u201d \u201cIf I hand it in, I\u2019ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it!\u201d \u201cBut what about Sirius Black?\u201d Hermione hissed. \u201cHe could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to",
        "know!\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t be getting in through a passage,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cThere are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the other three \u2014 one of them\u2019s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of them\u2019s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can\u2019t get out of it. And the one I just came through \u2014 well \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there \u2026\u201d Harry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage was there? Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door. \u2014 BY ORDER OF \u2014 THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Customers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be patrolling the",
        "streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall. Merry Christmas!\u201cSee?\u201d said Ron quietly. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn\u2019t they? They live over the shop!\u201d \u201cYes, but \u2014 but \u2014\u201d Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another problem. \u201cLook, Harry still shouldn\u2019t be coming into Hogsmeade.

Harry deserves a break.\u201d Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried. \u201cAre you going to report me?\u201d Harry asked her, grinning. \u201cOh \u2014 of course not \u2014 but honestly, Harry \u2014\u201d \u201cSeen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?\u201d said Ron, grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel. \u201cAnd the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven \u2014 it burnt a hole right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick.\u201d Ron stared broodingly into the Acid Pop box. \u201cReckon Fred\u2019d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?\u201d When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside. Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer",
        "of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees. Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn\u2019t have his cloak. They headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting through their scarves. \u201cThat\u2019s the post office \u2014\u201d \u201cZonko\u2019s is up there \u2014\u201d \u201cWe could go up to the Shrieking Shack \u2014\u201d\u201cTell you what,\u201d said Ron, his teeth chattering, \u201cshall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?\u201d Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn. It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar. \u201cThat\u2019s Madam Rosmerta,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019ll get the drinks, shall",
        "I?\u201d he added, going slightly red. Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d he said happily, raising his tankard. Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he\u2019d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside. A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked. Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime- green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak \u2014 Cornelius Fudge, Minister of",
        "Magic. In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of Harry\u2019s head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers\u2019 and Fudge\u2019s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward him. Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, \u201cMobiliarbus!\u201d The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground, drifted sideways, and landed with a softthump right in front of their table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down. Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman\u2019s voice. \u201cA small",

Have one yourself, won\u2019t you? Come and join us. \u2026\u201d \u201cWell, thank you very much, Minister.\u201d Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn\u2019t it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too? And how long were they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight. \u2026 Hermione\u2019s leg gave a nervous twitch next to him. \u201cSo, what brings you to this",
        "neck of the woods, Minister?\u201d came Madam Rosmerta\u2019s voice. Harry saw the lower part of Fudge\u2019s thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, \u201cWhat else, m\u2019dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween?\u201d \u201cI did hear a rumor,\u201d admitted Madam Rosmerta. \u201cDid you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?\u201d said Professor McGonagall exasperatedly. \u201cDo you think Black\u2019s still in the area, Minister?\u201d whispered Madam Rosmerta.\u201cI\u2019m sure of it,\u201d said Fudge shortly. \u201cYou know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice?\u201d said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. \u201cScared all my customers away. \u2026 It\u2019s very bad for business, Minister.\u201d \u201cRosmerta, m\u2019dear, I don\u2019t like them any more than you do,\u201d said Fudge uncomfortably. \u201cNecessary precaution \u2026 unfortunate, but there you are. \u2026 I\u2019ve just met some",
        "of them. They\u2019re in a fury against Dumbledore \u2014 he won\u2019t let them inside the castle grounds.\u201d \u201cI should think not,\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply. \u201cHow are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?\u201d \u201cHear, hear!\u201d squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground. \u201cAll the same,\u201d demurred Fudge, \u201cthey are here to protect you all from something much worse. \u2026 We all know what Black\u2019s capable of. \u2026\u201d \u201cDo you know, I still have trouble believing it,\u201d said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. \u201cOf all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I\u2019d have thought \u2026 I mean, I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you\u2019d told me then what he was going to become, I\u2019d have said you\u2019d had too much mead.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it, Rosmerta,\u201d said Fudge",
        "gruffly. \u201cThe worst he did isn\u2019t widely known.\u201d \u201cThe worst?\u201d said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity. \u201cWorse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?\u201d \u201cI certainly do,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that. What could possibly be worse?\u201d \u201cYou say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,\u201d murmured Professor McGonagall. \u201cDo you remember who his best friend was?\u201d \u201cNaturally,\u201d said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. \u201cNever saw one without the other, did you? The number oftimes I had them in here \u2014 ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!\u201d Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him. \u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cBlack and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course \u2014 exceptionally bright, in fact \u2014 but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers \u2014\u201d \u201cI dunno,\u201d",
        "chuckled Hagrid. \u201cFred and George Weasley could give \u2019em a run fer their money.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!\u201d chimed in Professor Flitwick. \u201cInseparable!\u201d \u201cOf course they were,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cPotter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.\u201d \u201cBecause Black turned out to be in league with You-Know- Who?\u201d whispered Madam Rosmerta. \u201cWorse even than that, m\u2019dear. \u2026\u201d Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. \u201cNot many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at",
        "once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn\u2019t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\u201d \u201cHow does that work?\u201d said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his throat. \u201cAn immensely complex spell,\u201d he said squeakily, \u201cinvolving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find \u2014 unless, of course, the Secret-Keeperchooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!\u201d \u201cSo Black was the Potters\u2019 Secret-Keeper?\u201d whispered Madam Rosmerta. \u201cNaturally,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cJames Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than",
        "tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself \u2026 and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters\u2019 Secret-Keeper himself.\u201d \u201cHe suspected Black?\u201d gasped Madam Rosmerta. \u201cHe was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,\u201d said Professor McGonagall darkly. \u201cIndeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.\u201d \u201cBut James Potter insisted on using Black?\u201d \u201cHe did,\u201d said Fudge heavily. \u201cAnd then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed \u2014\u201d \u201cBlack betrayed them?\u201d breathed Madam Rosmerta. \u201cHe did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know- Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters\u2019 death. But, as we all",
        "know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it \u2014\u201d \u201cFilthy, stinkin\u2019 turncoat!\u201d Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet. \u201cShh!\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI met him!\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cI musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people! It was me whatrescued Harry from Lily an\u2019 James\u2019s house after they was killed! Jus\u2019 got him outta the ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an\u2019 his parents dead \u2026 an\u2019 Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin\u2019 motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin\u2019 there. I didn\u2019 know",
        "he\u2019d bin Lily an\u2019 James\u2019s Secret-Keeper. Thought he\u2019d jus\u2019 heard the news o\u2019 You-Know-Who\u2019s attack an\u2019 come ter see what he could do. White an\u2019 shakin\u2019, he was. An\u2019 yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN\u2019 TRAITOR!\u201d Hagrid roared. \u201cHagrid, please!\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d \u201cHow was I ter know he wasn\u2019 upset abou\u2019 Lily an\u2019 James? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou\u2019! An\u2019 then he says, \u2018Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I\u2019m his godfather, I\u2019ll look after him \u2014\u2019 Ha! But I\u2019d had me orders from Dumbledore, an\u2019 I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an\u2019 uncle\u2019s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. \u2018I won\u2019t need it anymore,\u2019 he says. \u201cI shoulda known there was somethin\u2019 fishy goin\u2019 on then. He loved that motorbike, what",
        "was he givin\u2019 it ter me for? Why wouldn\u2019 he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he\u2019d bin the Potters\u2019 Secret- Keeper. Black knew he was goin\u2019 ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o\u2019 hours before the Ministry was after him. \u201cBut what if I\u2019d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he\u2019d\u2019ve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes\u2019 friends\u2019 son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 and no one that matters to \u2019em anymore. \u2026\u201d A long silence followed Hagrid\u2019s story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, \u201cBut he didn\u2019t manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!\u201d\u201cAlas, if only we had,\u201d said Fudge bitterly. \u201cIt was not we who found him. It was little Peter",
        "Pettigrew \u2014 another of the Potters\u2019 friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters\u2019 Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.\u201d \u201cPettigrew \u2026 that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?\u201d said Madam Rosmerta. \u201cHero-worshipped Black and Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cNever quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather sharp with him. You can imagine how I \u2014 how I regret that now. \u2026\u201d She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold. \u201cThere, now, Minerva,\u201d said Fudge kindly, \u201cPettigrew died a hero\u2019s death. Eyewitnesses \u2014 Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later \u2014 told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing, \u2018Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?\u2019 And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens. \u2026\u201d Professor McGonagall blew her nose and",
        "said thickly, \u201cStupid boy \u2026 foolish boy \u2026 he was always hopeless at dueling \u2026 should have left it to the Ministry. \u2026\u201d \u201cI tell yeh, if I\u2019d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve messed around with wands \u2014 I\u2019d\u2019ve ripped him limb \u2014 from \u2014 limb,\u201d Hagrid growled. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Hagrid,\u201d said Fudge sharply. \u201cNobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people. I \u2014 I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing",
        "there laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him \u2026 a heap of bloodstained robes and a few \u2014 a few fragments \u2014\u201dFudge\u2019s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being blown. \u201cWell, there you have it, Rosmerta,\u201d said Fudge thickly. \u201cBlack was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was some comfort to his poor mother. Black\u2019s been in Azkaban ever since.\u201d Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh. \u201cIs it true he\u2019s mad, Minister?\u201d \u201cI wish I could say that he was,\u201d said Fudge slowly. \u201cI certainly believe his master\u2019s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man \u2014 cruel \u2026 pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of",
        "Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there\u2019s no sense in them \u2026 but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You\u2019d have thought he was merely bored \u2014 asked if I\u2019d finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him \u2014 and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night.\u201d \u201cBut what do you think he\u2019s broken out to do?\u201d said Madam Rosmerta. \u201cGood gracious, Minister, he isn\u2019t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?\u201d \u201cI daresay that is his \u2014 er \u2014 eventual plan,\u201d said Fudge evasively. \u201cBut we hope to catch Black long before that. I",
        "must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing \u2026 but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he\u2019ll rise again. \u2026\u201d There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their glass. \u201cYou know, Cornelius, if you\u2019re dining with the headmaster, we\u2019d better head back up to the castle,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta\u2019s glittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the Three Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the teachers had disappeared. \u201cHarry?\u201d Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces appeared under the table. They were both staring at him, lost for words."

    "Chapter 11": [
        "The Firebolt Harry didn\u2019t have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard. Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge \u2026 why hadn\u2019t anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry\u2019s parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them? Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what they\u2019d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of",
        "end-of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn\u2019t want Fred and George asking him whether he\u2019d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for \u2014 the leather- bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until \u2026He stopped on a picture of his parents\u2019 wedding day. There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there \u2026 that must be him. Their best man \u2026 Harry had never given him a thought before.",
        "If he hadn\u2019t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn\u2019t sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him unrecognizable? But the dementors don\u2019t affect him, Harry thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn\u2019t have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close \u2014 Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view. The dormitory door opened. \u201cHarry?\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice uncertainly. But Harry lay still, pretending",
        "to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open. A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black\u2019s voice might sound like) a low, excited mutter. \u201cIt has happened, My Lord \u2026 the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper. \u2026\u201d And then came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh thatHarry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near. \u2026 \u201cHarry, you \u2014 you look terrible.\u201d Harry hadn\u2019t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to",
        "find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had spread her homework over three tables. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d said Harry. \u201cGone! It\u2019s the first day of the holidays, remember?\u201d said Ron, watching Harry closely. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute.\u201d Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug. \u201cYou really don\u2019t look well, you know,\u201d Hermione said, peering anxiously into his face. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHarry, listen,\u201d said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, \u201cyou must be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn\u2019t go",
        "doing anything stupid.\u201d \u201cLike what?\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike trying to go after Black,\u201d said Ron sharply. Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep. He didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cYou won\u2019t, will you, Harry?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBecause Black\u2019s not worth dying for,\u201d said Ron. Harry looked at them. They didn\u2019t seem to understand at all. \u201cD\u2019you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?\u201d Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. \u201cI can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you\u2019d heard your mumscreaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn\u2019t forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do!\u201d said Hermione, looking stricken. \u201cThe dementors will catch Black and",
        "he\u2019ll go back to Azkaban and \u2014 and serve him right!\u201d \u201cYou heard what Fudge said. Black isn\u2019t affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It\u2019s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.\u201d \u201cSo what are you saying?\u201d said Ron, looking very tense. \u201cYou want to \u2014 to kill Black or something?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Hermione in a panicky voice. \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?\u201d Again, Harry didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand. \u201cMalfoy knows,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cRemember what he said to me in Potions? \u2018If it was me, I\u2019d hunt him down myself. \u2026 I\u2019d want revenge.\u2019 \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to take Malfoy\u2019s advice instead of ours?\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cListen \u2026 you",
        "know what Pettigrew\u2019s mother got back after Black had finished with him? Dad told me \u2014 the Order of Merlin, First Class, and Pettigrew\u2019s finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they could find. Black\u2019s a madman, Harry, and he\u2019s dangerous \u2014\u201d \u201cMalfoy\u2019s dad must have told him,\u201d said Harry, ignoring Ron. \u201cHe was right in Voldemort\u2019s inner circle \u2014\u201d \u201cSay You-Know-Who, will you?\u201d interjected Ron angrily. \u201c\u2014 so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 and Malfoy\u2019d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy\u2019s just hoping you\u2019ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch.\u201d \u201cHarry, please,\u201d said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, \u201cplease be sensible. Black did a terrible, terriblething, but d-don\u2019t put yourself in danger, it\u2019s what Black wants. \u2026 Oh, Harry, you\u2019d be playing",
        "right into Black\u2019s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn\u2019t want you to get hurt, would they? They\u2019d never want you to go looking for Black!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never know what they\u2019d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I\u2019ve never spoken to them,\u201d said Harry shortly. There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously, flexing his claws. Ron\u2019s pocket quivered. \u201cLook,\u201d said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, \u201cit\u2019s the holidays! It\u2019s nearly Christmas! Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go down and see Hagrid. We haven\u2019t visited him for ages!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione quickly. \u201cHarry isn\u2019t supposed to leave the castle, Ron \u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Harry, sitting up, \u201cand I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!\u201d Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn\u2019t what Ron had had in mind. \u201cOr we",
        "could have a game of chess,\u201d he said hastily, \u201cor Gobstones. Percy left a set \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, let\u2019s visit Hagrid,\u201d said Harry firmly. So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole (\u201cStand and fight, you yellow- bellied mongrels!\u201d), down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors. They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid\u2019s cabin looked like an iced cake. Ron knocked, but there was no answer. \u201cHe\u2019s not out, is he?\u201d said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak. Ron had his ear to the door.\u201cThere\u2019s a weird noise,\u201d he said. \u201cListen \u2014 is that Fang?\u201d Harry and Hermione put their",
        "ears to the door too. From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans. \u201cThink we\u2019d better go and get someone?\u201d said Ron nervously. \u201cHagrid!\u201d called Harry, thumping the door. \u201cHagrid, are you in there?\u201d There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the front of his leather vest. \u201cYeh\u2019ve heard?\u201d he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry\u2019s neck. Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid\u2019s weight, was rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard. \u201cHagrid,",
        "what is it?\u201d said Hermione, aghast. Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s this, Hagrid?\u201d Hagrid\u2019s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mr. Hagrid, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident. \u201cWell, that\u2019s okay then, Hagrid!\u201d said Ron, clapping Hagrid on the shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on.However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April 20th, and we ask",
        "you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the Committee\u2019s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship \u2026 There followed a list of the school governors. \u201cOh,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut you said Buckbeak isn\u2019t a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he\u2019ll get off\u2014\u201d \u201cYeh don\u2019 know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o\u2019 Dangerous Creatures!\u201d choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. \u201cThey\u2019ve got it in fer interestin\u2019 creatures!\u201d A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid\u2019s cabin made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor. \u201cI couldn\u2019 leave him tied up out there in the snow!\u201d choked Hagrid. \u201cAll on his own! At Christmas.\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never",
        "seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called \u201cinteresting creatures\u201d and other people called \u201cterrifying monsters.\u201d On the other hand, there didn\u2019t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid\u2019s usual standards, he was positively cute. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid\u2019s massive forearm. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t make no diff\u2019rence!\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cThem Disposal devils, they\u2019re all in Lucius Malfoy\u2019s pocket! Scared o\u2019 him! An\u2019 if I lose the case, Buckbeak \u2014\u201dHagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and lurched forward, his face in his arms. \u201cWhat about Dumbledore, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s done more\u2019n enough fer me already,\u201d groaned Hagrid. \u201cGot enough on his plate what with keepin\u2019 them dementors outta the castle, an\u2019 Sirius Black lurkin\u2019",
        "around \u2014\u201d Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared. \u201cListen, Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t give up. Hermione\u2019s right, you just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully, \u201cwhere the hippogriff got off. I\u2019ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.\u201d Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them. \u201cEr \u2014 shall I make a cup of tea?\u201d said Ron. Harry stared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s what my mum does whenever someone\u2019s upset,\u201d Ron muttered, shrugging. At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea in",
        "front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said, \u201cYer right. I can\u2019 afford to go ter pieces. Gotta pull meself together. \u2026\u201d Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on Hagrid\u2019s knee. \u201cI\u2019ve not bin meself lately,\u201d said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other. \u201cWorried abou\u2019 Buckbeak, an\u2019 no one likin\u2019 me classes \u2014\u201d \u201cWe do like them!\u201d lied Hermione at once. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re great!\u201d said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table. \u201cEr \u2014 how are the flobberworms?\u201d\u201cDead,\u201d said Hagrid gloomily. \u201cToo much lettuce.\u201d \u201cOh no!\u201d said Ron, his lip twitching. \u201cAn\u2019 them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an\u2019 all,\u201d said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. \u201cGotta walk past \u2019em ev\u2019ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. \u2019S like bein\u2019 back in",
        "Azkaban \u2014\u201d He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, \u201cIs it awful in there, Hagrid?\u201d \u201cYeh\u2019ve no idea,\u201d said Hagrid quietly. \u201cNever bin anywhere like it. Thought I was goin\u2019 mad. Kep\u2019 goin\u2019 over horrible stuff in me mind \u2026 the day I got expelled from Hogwarts \u2026 day me dad died \u2026 day I had ter let Norbert go. \u2026\u201d His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards. \u201cYeh can\u2019 really remember who yeh are after a while. An\u2019 yeh can\u2019 see the point o\u2019 livin\u2019 at all. I used ter hope I\u2019d jus\u2019 die in me sleep. \u2026 When they let me out, it was like bein\u2019 born again, ev\u2019rythin\u2019 came floodin\u2019",
        "back, it was the bes\u2019 feelin\u2019 in the world. Mind, the dementors weren\u2019t keen on lettin\u2019 me go.\u201d \u201cBut you were innocent!\u201d said Hermione. Hagrid snorted. \u201cThink that matters to them? They don\u2019 care. Long as they\u2019ve got a couple o\u2019 hundred humans stuck there with \u2019em, so they can leech all the happiness out of \u2019em, they don\u2019 give a damn who\u2019s guilty an\u2019 who\u2019s not.\u201d Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said quietly, \u201cThought o\u2019 jus\u2019 letting Buckbeak go \u2026 tryin\u2019 ter make him fly away \u2026 but how d\u2019yeh explain ter a hippogriff it\u2019s gotta go inter hidin\u2019? An\u2019 \u2014 an\u2019 I\u2019m scared o\u2019 breakin\u2019 the law. \u2026\u201d He looked up at them, tears leaking down his face again. \u201cI don\u2019 ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.\u201dThe trip to Hagrid\u2019s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect Ron",
        "and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black, he couldn\u2019t brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts, speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant. \u201cHere\u2019s something \u2026 there was a case in 1722 \u2026 but the hippogriff was convicted \u2014 ugh, look what they did to it, that\u2019s disgusting \u2014\u201d \u201cThis might help, look \u2014 a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they let the manticore off \u2014 oh \u2014 no, that was only because everyone",
        "was too scared to go near it. \u2026\u201d Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron\u2019s pocket to sniff hopefully at the air. On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him. \u201cOy! Presents!\u201d Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of",
        "parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.\u201cAnother sweater from Mum \u2026 maroon again \u2026 see if you\u2019ve got one.\u201d Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand. \u201cDunno \u2026\u201d Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said hoarsely. It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered",
        "as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail. \u201cWho sent it to you?\u201d said Ron in a hushed voice. \u201cLook and see if there\u2019s a card,\u201d said Harry. Ron ripped apart the Firebolt\u2019s wrappings. \u201cNothing! Blimey, who\u2019d spend that much on you?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, feeling stunned, \u201cI\u2019m betting it wasn\u2019t the Dursleys.\u201d \u201cI bet it was Dumbledore,\u201d said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \u201cHe sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously. \u2026\u201d \u201cThat was my dad\u2019s, though,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDumbledore was just passing it on to me. He wouldn\u2019t spend hundreds of Galleons on",
        "me. He can\u2019t go giving students stuff like this \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why he wouldn\u2019t say it was from him!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIn case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey,Harry\u201d \u2014 Ron gave a great whoop of laughter \u2014 \u201cMalfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He\u2019ll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry\u2019s bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. \u201cWho \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Ron, controlling himself, \u201cI know who it could\u2019ve been \u2014 Lupin!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, now starting to laugh himself. \u201cLupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he\u2019d be able to buy himself some new robes.\u201d \u201cYeah, but he likes you,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he",
        "might\u2019ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you \u2014\u201d \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, he was away?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe was ill when I was playing in that match.\u201d \u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t in the hospital wing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?\u201d Harry frowned at Ron. \u201cI can\u2019t see Lupin affording something like this.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019re you two laughing about?\u201d Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t bring him in here!\u201d said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket. But Hermione wasn\u2019t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus\u2019s empty bed and stared, open- mouthed, at the Firebolt. \u201cOh, Harry! Who sent you that?\u201d \u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a card or anything with it.\u201d To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione slowly, \u201cbut it\u2019s a bit odd, isn\u2019t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron sighed exasperatedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the best broom there is, Hermione,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it must\u2019ve been really expensive. \u2026\u201d \u201cProbably cost more than all the Slytherins\u2019 brooms put together,\u201d said Ron happily. \u201cWell \u2026 who\u2019d send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they\u2019d sent it?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWho cares?\u201d said Ron impatiently. \u201cListen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. Harry and Ron",
        "looked at her. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think Harry\u2019s going to do with it \u2014 sweep the floor?\u201d said Ron. But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus\u2019s bed, right at Ron\u2019s chest. \u201cGET \u2014 HIM \u2014 OUT \u2014 OF \u2014 HERE!\u201d Ron bellowed as Crookshanks\u2019s claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry\u2019s bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain. Crookshanks\u2019s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor. \u201cI forgot about that!\u201d Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. \u201cI never wear those socks if I can help",
        "it. \u2026\u201d The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.\u201cYou\u2019d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\u201d said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry\u2019s bed nursing his toe. \u201cCan\u2019t you shut that thing up?\u201d he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks\u2019s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron. Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron\u2019s stifled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron\u2019s hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron\u2019s pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too. \u201cHe\u2019s not looking too good, is he?\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s stress!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019d be fine",
        "if that big stupid furball left him alone!\u201d But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn\u2019t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron\u2019s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died. Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks\u2019s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as",
        "well; she didn\u2019t say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat. At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall,Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table. \u201cAs there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables. \u2026 Sit down, sit down!\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the",
        "end of the table. \u201cCrackers!\u201d said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witch\u2019s hat topped with a stuffed vulture. Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron\u2019s eye and they both grinned; Snape\u2019s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard\u2019s hat at once. \u201cDig in!\u201d he advised the table, beaming around. As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly. \u201cSibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!\u201d said Dumbledore, standing up. \u201cI have been crystal gazing,",
        "Headmaster,\u201d said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway voice, \u201cand to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness. \u2026\u201d \u201cCertainly, certainly,\u201d said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \u201cLet me draw you up a chair \u2014\u201dAnd he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream. \u201cI dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be",
        "the first to die!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll risk it, Sibyll,\u201d said Professor McGonagall impatiently. \u201cDo sit down, the turkey\u2019s getting stone cold.\u201d Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen. \u201cTripe, Sibyll?\u201d Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, \u201cBut where is dear Professor Lupin?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\u201d said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves. \u201cMost unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.\u201d \u201cBut surely you already knew that, Sibyll?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised. Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look. \u201cCertainly I knew, Minerva,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am",
        "not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.\u201d \u201cThat explains a great deal,\u201d said Professor McGonagall tartly. Professor Trelawney\u2019s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty. \u201cIf you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seemsaware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him \u2014\u201d \u201cImagine that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall dryly. \u201cI doubt,\u201d said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney\u2019s conversation, \u201cthat Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you\u2019ve made the potion for him again?\u201d \u201cYes, Headmaster,\u201d said Snape. \u201cGood,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThen he should be up and about in no time. \u2026 Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas? They\u2019re excellent.\u201d The first-year boy went furiously red",
        "on being addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands. Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later. Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly. \u201cMy dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?\u201d \u201cDunno,\u201d said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry. \u201cI doubt it will make much difference,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, \u201cunless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall.\u201d Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted. \u201cComing?\u201d Harry said to Hermione. \u201cNo,\u201d Hermione muttered, \u201cI want a quick word with Professor McGonagall.\u201d \u201cProbably trying to see if she can take any more classes,\u201d yawned Ron as they made their way into the entrance hall, which was completely devoid",
        "of mad axe-men. When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts, and hisfat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted them with a flagon of mead. \u201cMerry \u2014 hic \u2014 Christmas! Password?\u201d \u201cScurvy cur,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd the same to you, sir!\u201d roared Sir Cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them. Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Though",
        "Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, Harry had seen her in the common room only once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them, sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her face behind it. \u201cSo that\u2019s it, is it?\u201d said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. \u201cMiss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.\u201d Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down. \u201cMay I?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, but she didn\u2019t wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. \u201cHmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card?",
        "No message of any kind?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cI see \u2026 ,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I will have to take this, Potter.\u201d \u201cW \u2014 what?\u201d said Harry, scrambling to his feet. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt will need to be checked for jinxes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down \u2014\u201d \u201cStrip it down?\u201d repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take more than a few weeks,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cYou will have it back if we are sure it is jinx- free.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it!\u201d said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. \u201cHonestly, Professor \u2014\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t know that, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \u201cnot until you\u2019ve flown it, at any rate, and I\u2019m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered",
        "with. I shall keep you informed.\u201d Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. \u201cWhat did you go running to McGonagall for?\u201d Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly. \u201cBecause I thought \u2014 and Professor McGonagall agrees with me \u2014 that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!\u201d"

    "Chapter 12": [
        "The Patronus Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn\u2019t stop him from being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he didn\u2019t know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests? Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the stripping-down of a brand-new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn\u2019t try to persuade her to come back. All in all, they were glad",
        "when the rest of the school returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again. Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started. \u201cHad a good Christmas?\u201d he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After the last match, you know. If the dementors come to the next one \u2026 I mean \u2026 we can\u2019t afford you to \u2014 well \u2014\u201d Wood broke off, looking awkward.\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cProfessor Lupin said he\u2019d train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He said he\u2019d have time after Christmas.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Wood, his expression clearing. \u201cWell, in that case \u2014 I really didn\u2019t want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said",
        "Harry. \u201cWhat! You\u2019d better get a move on, you know \u2014 you can\u2019t ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!\u201d \u201cHe got a Firebolt for Christmas,\u201d said Ron. \u201cA Firebolt? No! Seriously? A \u2014 a real Firebolt?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get excited, Oliver,\u201d said Harry gloomily. \u201cI haven\u2019t got it anymore. It was confiscated.\u201d And he explained all about how the Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes. \u201cJinxed? How could it be jinxed?\u201d \u201cSirius Black,\u201d Harry said wearily. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it.\u201d Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his Seeker, Wood said, \u201cBut Black couldn\u2019t have bought a Firebolt! He\u2019s on the run! The whole country\u2019s on the lookout for him! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut McGonagall still wants to strip it down \u2014\u201d Wood",
        "went pale. \u201cI\u2019ll go and talk to her, Harry,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ll make her see reason. \u2026 A Firebolt \u2026 a real Firebolt, on our team \u2026 She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do. \u2026 I\u2019ll make her see sense. A Firebolt \u2026\u201d Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. Thefirst Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen. It",
        "was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible. \u201cAh yes,\u201d said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class. \u201cLet me see \u2026 how about eight o\u2019clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough. \u2026 I\u2019ll have to think carefully about how we\u2019re going to do this. \u2026 We can\u2019t bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on. \u2026\u201d \u201cStill looks ill, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner. \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d There was a loud and impatient \u201ctuh\u201d from behind them. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was so full of",
        "books it wouldn\u2019t close. \u201cAnd what are you tutting at us for?\u201d said Ron irritably. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her shoulder. \u201cYes, you were,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI said I wonder what\u2019s wrong with Lupin, and you \u2014\u201d \u201cWell, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d said Hermione, with a look of maddening superiority. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell us, don\u2019t,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cFine,\u201d said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to get us to talk to her again.\u201d At eight o\u2019clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when ProfessorLupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor Binns\u2019 desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s",
        "that?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnother boggart,\u201d said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. \u201cI\u2019ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch\u2019s filing cabinet. It\u2019s the nearest we\u2019ll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we\u2019ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we\u2019re not using him; there\u2019s a cupboard under my desk he\u2019ll like.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn\u2019t apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor. \u201cSo \u2026\u201d Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \u201cThe spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry \u2014 well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called",
        "the Patronus Charm.\u201d \u201cHow does it work?\u201d said Harry nervously. \u201cWell, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cwhich is a kind of anti-dementor \u2014 a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\u201d Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \u201cThe Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon \u2014 hope, happiness, the desire to survive \u2014 but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can\u2019t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\u201d \u201cWhat does a Patronus look like?\u201d said Harry curiously. \u201cEach one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\u201d \u201cAnd how do you conjure it?\u201d \u201cWith",
        "an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happymemory.\u201d Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys\u2019 was going to do. Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach. \u201cThe incantation is this \u2014\u201d Lupin cleared his throat. \u201cExpecto patronum!\u201d \u201cExpecto patronum,\u201d Harry repeated under his breath, \u201cexpecto patronum.\u201d \u201cConcentrating hard on your happy memory?\u201d \u201cOh \u2014 yeah \u2014\u201d said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride. \u201cExpecto patrono \u2014 no, patronum \u2014 sorry \u2014 expecto patronum, expecto patronum \u2014\u201d Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d said",
        "Harry excitedly. \u201cSomething happened!\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d said Lupin, smiling. \u201cRight, then \u2014 ready to try it on a dementor?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding. \u2026 Any second now, he might hear his mother again \u2026 but he shouldn\u2019t think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn\u2019t want to \u2026 or did he? Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled. A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him \u2014 \u201cExpecto patronum!\u201d Harry yelled.",
        "\u201cExpecto patronum! Expecto \u2014\u201dBut the classroom and the dementor were dissolving. \u2026 Harry was falling again through thick white fog, and his mother\u2019s voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head \u2014 \u201cNot Harry! Not Harry! Please \u2014 I\u2019ll do anything \u2014\u201d \u201cStand aside. Stand aside, girl!\u201d \u201cHarry!\u201d Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn\u2019t have to ask what had happened. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Lupin. \u201cYes \u2026\u201d Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it. \u201cHere \u2014\u201d Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. \u201cEat this before we try again. I didn\u2019t expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse,\u201d",
        "Harry muttered, biting off the Frog\u2019s head. \u201cI could hear her louder that time \u2014 and him \u2014 Voldemort \u2014\u201d Lupin looked paler than usual. \u201cHarry, if you don\u2019t want to continue, I will more than understand \u2014\u201d \u201cI do!\u201d said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can\u2019t afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we\u2019ve lost the Quidditch Cup!\u201d \u201cAll right then \u2026 ,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cYou might want to select another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on. \u2026 That one doesn\u2019t seem to have been strong enough. \u2026\u201d Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He gripped his wandtightly again and took up his position in",
        "the middle of the classroom. \u201cReady?\u201d said Lupin, gripping the box lid. \u201cReady,\u201d said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened. \u201cGo!\u201d said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry \u2014 \u201cExpecto patronum!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cExpecto patronum! Expecto pat \u2014\u201d White fog obscured his senses \u2026 big, blurred shapes were moving around him \u2026 then came a new voice, a man\u2019s voice, shouting, panicking \u2014 \u201cLily, take Harry and go! It\u2019s him! Go! Run! I\u2019ll hold him off \u2014\u201d The sounds of someone stumbling from a room \u2014 a door bursting open \u2014 a cackle of high-pitched laughter \u2014 \u201cHarry! Harry \u2026 wake up. \u2026\u201d Lupin was tapping Harry",
        "hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor. \u201cI heard my dad,\u201d Harry mumbled. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard him \u2014 he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it. \u2026\u201d Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn\u2019t see. \u201cYou heard James?\u201d said Lupin in a strange voice. \u201cYeah \u2026\u201d Face dry, Harry looked up. \u201cWhy \u2014 you didn\u2019t know my dad, did you?\u201d \u201cI \u2014 I did, as a matter of fact,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWe were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry \u2014 perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculouslyadvanced. \u2026",
        "I shouldn\u2019t have suggested putting you through this. \u2026\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Harry. He got up again. \u201cI\u2019ll have one more go! I\u2019m not thinking of happy enough things, that\u2019s what it is. \u2026 Hang on. \u2026\u201d He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory \u2026 one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus \u2026 The moment when he\u2019d first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn\u2019t a happy memory, he didn\u2019t know what was. \u2026 Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he\u2019d realized he\u2019d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more. \u201cReady?\u201d said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment. \u201cConcentrating hard? All right \u2014 go!\u201d He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and",
        "the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark \u2014 \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d Harry bellowed. \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d The screaming inside Harry\u2019s head had started again \u2014 except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio \u2014 softer and louder and softer again \u2014 and he could still see the dementor \u2014 it had halted \u2014 and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry\u2019s wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry\u2019s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet \u2014 though for how much longer, he wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d roared Lupin, springing forward. There was a loud crack, and Harry\u2019s cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he\u2019d just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out",
        "of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again. \u201cExcellent!\u201d Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \u201cExcellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!\u201d\u201cCan we have another go? Just one more go?\u201d \u201cNot now,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve had enough for one night. Here \u2014\u201d He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes\u2019 best chocolate. \u201cEat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him. \u201cProfessor Lupin?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you knew my dad, you must\u2019ve known Sirius Black as well.\u201d Lupin turned very quickly. \u201cWhat gives you that idea?\u201d he said",
        "sharply. \u201cNothing \u2014 I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too. \u2026\u201d Lupin\u2019s face relaxed. \u201cYes, I knew him,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cOr I thought I did. You\u2019d better be off, Harry, it\u2019s getting late.\u201d Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn\u2019t mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry\u2019s thoughts wandered back to his mother and father. \u2026 He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents\u2019 last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he\u2019d never be able to produce a proper Patronus if",
        "he half wanted to hear his parents again. \u2026 \u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d he told himself sternly. \u201cThey\u2019re dead and listening to echoes of them won\u2019t bring them back. You\u2019d better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.\u201dHe stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower. Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week. This meant that with Lupin\u2019s anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he wasn\u2019t showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be",
        "getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books. \u201cDoing what?\u201d \u201cGetting to all her classes!\u201d Ron said. \u201cI heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday\u2019s lesson, but Hermione can\u2019t\u2019ve been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she\u2019s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same",
        "time as Divination, and she\u2019s never missed one of them either!\u201d Harry didn\u2019t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione\u2019s impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape\u2019s essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.\u201cBad news, Harry. I\u2019ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She \u2014 er \u2014 got a bit shirty with me. Told me I\u2019d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn\u2019t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.\u201d Wood shook his head in disbelief. \u201cHonestly, the way she was yelling at me \u2026 you\u2019d think I\u2019d said something terrible. \u2026 Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it. \u2026\u201d",
        "He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall\u2019s severe voice. \u201c \u2018As long as necessary, Wood\u2019 \u2026 I reckon it\u2019s time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There\u2019s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick \u2026 you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy\u2019s got.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\u201d said Harry flatly. January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn\u2019t ordered a new broom. He was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted. \u201cNo, Potter, you can\u2019t have it back yet,\u201d Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he\u2019d even opened his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ve checked for most of the usual",
        "curses, but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once we\u2019ve finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.\u201d To make matters even worse, Harry\u2019s anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semi- transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought tokeep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents\u2019 voices again. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting too much of yourself,\u201d said Professor Lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice. \u201cFor a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren\u2019t passing out anymore, are you?\u201d \u201cI thought a Patronus would",
        "\u2014 charge the dementors down or something,\u201d said Harry dispiritedly. \u201cMake them disappear \u2014\u201d \u201cThe true Patronus does do that,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut you\u2019ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.\u201d \u201cYou said it\u2019s harder if there are loads of them,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI have complete confidence in you,\u201d said Lupin, smiling. \u201cHere \u2014 you\u2019ve earned a drink \u2014 something from the Three Broomsticks. You won\u2019t have tried it before \u2014\u201d He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase. \u201cButterbeer!\u201d said Harry, without thinking. \u201cYeah, I like that stuff!\u201d Lupin raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh \u2014 Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\u201d Harry lied quickly. \u201cI see,\u201d said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious.",
        "\u201cWell \u2014 let\u2019s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I\u2019m supposed to take sides, as a teacher \u2026 ,\u201d he added hastily. They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he\u2019d been wondering for a while. \u201cWhat\u2019s under a dementor\u2019s hood?\u201d Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully. \u201cHmmm \u2026 well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cThey call it the Dementor\u2019s Kiss,\u201d said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and \u2014 and suck out his soul.\u201d Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer. \u201cWhat \u2014 they kill \u2014",
        "?\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cMuch worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you\u2019ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no \u2026 anything. There\u2019s no chance at all of recovery. You\u2019ll just \u2014 exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever \u2026 lost.\u201d Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him.\u201d Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black. \u201cHe deserves it,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cYou think so?\u201d said Lupin lightly. \u201cDo you really think anyone deserves that?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry defiantly. \u201cFor \u2026",
        "for some things \u2026\u201d He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he\u2019d overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he\u2019d gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn\u2019t be very impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom. Harry half wished that he hadn\u2019t asked what was under a dementor\u2019s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel liketo have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs. \u201cDo watch where you\u2019re going, Potter!\u201d \u201cSorry, Professor \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here it is, we\u2019ve done everything we could think of, and",
        "there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You\u2019ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter. \u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever. \u201cI can have it back?\u201d Harry said weakly. \u201cSeriously?\u201d \u201cSeriously,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \u201cI daresay you\u2019ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday\u2019s match, won\u2019t you? And Potter \u2014 do try and win, won\u2019t you? Or we\u2019ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night. \u2026\u201d Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cShe gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?\u201d \u201cYeah \u2026 anything",
        "\u2026 ,\u201d said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. \u201cYou know what \u2014 we should make up with Hermione. \u2026 She was only trying to help. \u2026\u201d \u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe\u2019s in the common room now \u2014 working, for a change \u2014\u201d They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance. \u201cI wrote them down!\u201d Neville was saying tearfully. \u201cBut I must\u2019ve dropped them somewhere!\u201d \u201cA likely tale!\u201d roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: \u201cGood even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!\u201d\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville. \u201cI\u2019ve lost the passwords!\u201d Neville told them miserably. \u201cI made him tell me what passwords he was going to",
        "use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done with them!\u201d \u201cOddsbodikins,\u201d said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get it, Harry?\u201d \u201cWill you let me have a go?\u201d \u201cHave you ridden it yet, Harry?\u201d \u201cRavenclaw\u2019ll have no chance, they\u2019re all on Cleansweep Sevens!\u201d \u201cCan I just hold it, Harry?\u201d After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn\u2019t rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and",
        "at last, she looked up. \u201cI got it back,\u201d said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt. \u201cSee, Hermione? There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with it!\u201d said Ron. \u201cWell \u2014 there might have been!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI mean, at least you know now that it\u2019s safe!\u201d \u201cYeah, I suppose so,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019d better put it upstairs \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d said Ron eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.\u201d He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys\u2019 staircase. \u201cCan I sit down, then?\u201d Harry asked Hermione.\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair. Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\u201cExplain Why Muggles Need Electricity\u201d) and at the rune",
        "translation Hermione was now poring over. \u201cHow are you getting through all this stuff?\u201d Harry asked her. \u201cOh, well \u2014 you know \u2014 working hard,\u201d said Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just drop a couple of subjects?\u201d Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that!\u201d said Hermione, looking scandalized. \u201cArithmancy looks terrible,\u201d said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart. \u201cOh no, it\u2019s wonderful!\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite subject! It\u2019s \u2014\u201d But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys\u2019 staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder \u2014 and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet. \u201cLOOK!\u201d he",
        "bellowed, striding over to Hermione\u2019s table. \u201cLOOK!\u201d he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face. \u201cRon, what \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cSCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\u201d Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like \u2014 \u201cBLOOD!\u201d Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \u201cHE\u2019S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\u201d \u201cN \u2014 no,\u201d said Hermione in a trembling voice.Ron threw something down onto Hermione\u2019s rune translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs."

    "Chapter 13": [
        "Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione\u2019s friendship. Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn\u2019t see how they\u2019d ever make up. Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks\u2019s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn\u2019t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys\u2019 beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron\u2019s head in the Magical Menagerie. Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with",
        "Harry too. \u201cOkay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\u201d she said shrilly. \u201cFirst the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything\u2019s my fault, isn\u2019t it! Just leave me alone, Harry, I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do!\u201d Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\u201cCome on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\u201d said Fred bracingly \u201cAnd he\u2019s been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly \u2014 one swallow \u2014 he probably didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d \u201cFred!\u201d said Ginny indignantly. \u201cAll he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,\u201d said George. \u201cHe bit Goyle for us once!\u201d Ron said miserably. \u201cRemember, Harry?\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHis finest hour,\u201d said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. \u201cLet the scar on Goyle\u2019s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh,",
        "come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what\u2019s the point of moaning?\u201d In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team\u2019s final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they\u2019d finished. This did seem to take Ron\u2019s mind off Scabbers for a moment (\u201cGreat! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?\u201d) so they set off for the Quidditch field together. Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion. \u201cLook at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it\u2019s a slight list to the tail",
        "end \u2014 you often find they develop a drag after a few years. They\u2019ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows \u2014 a pity they\u2019ve stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too. \u2026\u201d She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, \u201cEr \u2014 Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Fireboltback? We need to practice. \u2026\u201d \u201cOh \u2014 right \u2014 here you are, then, Potter,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cI\u2019ll sit over here with Weasley \u2026\u201d She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow\u2019s match. \u201cHarry, I\u2019ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It\u2019s Cho Chang. She\u2019s a fourth year, and she\u2019s pretty good. \u2026 I",
        "really hoped she wouldn\u2019t be fit, she\u2019s had some problems with injuries. \u2026\u201d Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \u201cOn the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.\u201d He gave Harry\u2019s broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, \u201cOkay, everyone, let\u2019s go \u2014\u201d And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground. It was better than he\u2019d ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into",
        "the air again \u2014 \u201cHarry, I\u2019m letting the Snitch out!\u201d Wood called. Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand. The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute\u2019s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell\u2019s knee, looped her easily, and caught it again. It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again,Wood didn\u2019t have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first. \u201cI can\u2019t see what\u2019s going to stop us tomorrow!\u201d said Wood. \u201cNot unless \u2014 Harry,",
        "you\u2019ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger. \u201cThe dementors won\u2019t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore\u2019d go ballistic,\u201d said Fred confidently. \u201cWell, let\u2019s hope not,\u201d said Wood. \u201cAnyway \u2014 good work, everyone. Let\u2019s get back to the tower \u2026 turn in early \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\u201d Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat. \u201cHere you go,\u201d said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt. Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. Night had",
        "fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle. Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt\u2019s superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over \u2014 a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness. Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Ron. Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \u201cLumos!\u201d A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.\u201cGet out of here!\u201d Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass,",
        "but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. \u201cSee?\u201d Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \u201cShe\u2019s still letting him wander about wherever he wants \u2014 probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now. \u2026\u201d Harry didn\u2019t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn\u2019t say anything to Ron \u2014 nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall. Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the",
        "Great Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck. \u201cDid you see his face?\u201d said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfoy. \u201cHe can\u2019t believe it! This is brilliant!\u201d Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt. \u201cPut it here, Harry,\u201d he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy\u2019s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt. \u201cNow, now, Penny, no sabotage!\u201d said Percy heartily as she examined the Firebolt closely \u201cPenelope and I have gota",
        "bet on,\u201d he told the team. \u201cTen Galleons on the outcome of the match!\u201d Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to her table. \u201cHarry \u2014 make sure you win,\u201d said Percy, in an urgent whisper. \u201cI haven\u2019t got ten Galleons. Yes, I\u2019m coming, Penny!\u201d And he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast. \u201cSure you can manage that broom, Potter?\u201d said a cold, drawling voice. Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle right behind him. \u201cYeah, reckon so,\u201d said Harry casually. \u201cGot plenty of special features, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. \u201cShame it doesn\u2019t come with a parachute \u2014 in case you get too near a dementor.\u201d Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. \u201cPity you can\u2019t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThen it could catch the Snitch for you.\u201d The Gryffindor team laughed loudly.",
        "Malfoy\u2019s pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry\u2019s broom really was a Firebolt. At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn\u2019t have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn\u2019t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was",
        "in the crowd, watching.\u201cYou know what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. \u201cIf we lose this match, we\u2019re out of the running. Just \u2014 just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we\u2019ll be okay!\u201d They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn\u2019t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn\u2019t think had anything to do with nerves. \u201cWood, Davies, shake hands,\u201d Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with",
        "the Ravenclaw Captain. \u201cMount your brooms \u2026 on my whistle \u2026 three \u2014 two \u2014 one \u2014\u201d Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins\u2019 friend Lee Jordan. \u201cThey\u2019re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt\u2019s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year\u2019s World Championship \u2014\u201d \u201cJordan, would you mind telling us what\u2019s going on in the match?\u201d interrupted Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice. \u201cRight you are, Professor \u2014 just giving a bit of background information \u2014 the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and \u2014\u201d \u201cJordan!\u201d \u201cOkay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie",
        "Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal \u2026\u201dHarry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier \u2014 she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction. \u201cShow her your acceleration, Harry!\u201d Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia. Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it \u2014 the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers. Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him \u2014 Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten",
        "feet away \u2014 Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished. There was a great \u201cOoooooh\u201d of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it. \u201cGryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter\u2019s really putting it through its paces now, see it turn \u2014 Chang\u2019s Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt\u2019s precision-balance is really noticeable in these long \u2014\u201d \u201cJORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!\u201d Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three",
        "goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead \u2014 if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser,scanning the field frantically \u2014 a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings \u2014 the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post \u2014 Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead \u2014 but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him \u2014 \u201cHARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\u201d Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \u201cKNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\u201d Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him. \u2026 She\u2019d decided to mark him rather than search for",
        "the Snitch herself. \u2026 All right, then \u2026 if she wanted to tail him, she\u2019d have to take the consequences. \u2026 He dived again, and Cho, thinking he\u2019d seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time \u2014 the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end. He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second \u2014 then \u2014 \u201cOh!\u201d screamed Cho, pointing. Distracted, Harry looked down. Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at him. He didn\u2019t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, \u201cExpecto patronum!\u201d Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He",
        "knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn\u2019t pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead \u2014 he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy!\u201d Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off. In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a",
        "gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd. \u201cYes!\u201d Ron yelled, yanking Harry\u2019s arm into the air. \u201cYes! Yes!\u201d \u201cWell done, Harry!\u201d said Percy, looking delighted. \u201cTen Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me \u2014\u201d \u201cGood for you, Harry!\u201d roared Seamus Finnigan. \u201cRuddy brilliant!\u201d boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors. \u201cThat was quite some Patronus,\u201d said a voice in Harry\u2019s ear. Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased. \u201cThe dementors didn\u2019t affect me at all!\u201d Harry said excitedly. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a thing!\u201d \u201cThat would be because they \u2014 er \u2014 weren\u2019t dementors,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \u201cCome and see \u2014\u201d He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field. \u201cYou gave Mr. Malfoy quite a",
        "fright,\u201d said Lupin. Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle\u2019s shoulders. Standing over them,with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall. \u201cAn unworthy trick!\u201d she was shouting. \u201cA low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\u201d If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor\u2019s victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry\u2019s side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle\u2019s head still stuck inside it. \u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d",
        "said George, fighting his way over. \u201cParty! Gryffindor common room, now!\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle. It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd. \u201cWith a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\u201d Fred muttered in Harry\u2019s ear. Only one person wasn\u2019t joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled",
        "Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her. \u201cDid you even come to the match?\u201d he asked her. \u201cOf course I did,\u201d said Hermione in a strangely high- pitched voice, not looking up. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very glad we won,and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.\u201d \u201cCome on, Hermione, come and have some food,\u201d Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet. \u201cI can\u2019t, Harry. I\u2019ve still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!\u201d said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \u201cAnyway \u2026\u201d She glanced over at Ron too. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to join in.\u201d There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, \u201cIf",
        "Scabbers hadn\u2019t just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them \u2014\u201d Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls\u2019 dormitories and out of sight. \u201cCan\u2019t you give her a break?\u201d Harry asked Ron quietly. \u201cNo,\u201d said Ron flatly. \u201cIf she just acted like she was sorry \u2014 but she\u2019ll never admit she\u2019s wrong, Hermione. She\u2019s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.\u201d The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings",
        "of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep. \u2026 He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he wasrunning flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and \u2014 \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d Harry woke as suddenly as though he\u2019d been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings \u2014 he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan\u2019s voice from",
        "the other side of the room: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp. Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face. \u201cBlack! Sirius Black! With a knife!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHere! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!\u201d \u201cYou sure you weren\u2019t dreaming, Ron?\u201d said Dean. \u201cLook at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!\u201d They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy voices called after them. \u201cWho shouted?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was deserted.",
        "\u201cAre you sure you weren\u2019t dreaming, Ron?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I saw him!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s all the noise?\u201d \u201cProfessor McGonagall told us to go to bed!\u201d A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling on dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing. \u201cExcellent, are we carrying on?\u201d said Fred Weasley brightly.\u201cEveryone back upstairs!\u201d said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke. \u201cPerce \u2014 Sirius Black!\u201d said Ron faintly. \u201cIn our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!\u201d The common room went very still. \u201cNonsense!\u201d said Percy, looking startled. \u201cYou had too much to eat, Ron \u2014 had a nightmare \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling you \u2014\u201d \u201cNow, really, enough\u2019s enough!\u201d Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around. \u201cI am delighted that Gryffindor won the match,",
        "but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!\u201d \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t authorize this, Professor!\u201d said Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. \u201cI was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare \u2014\u201d \u201cIT WASN\u2019T A NIGHTMARE!\u201d Ron yelled. \u201cPROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!\u201d Professor McGonagall stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?\u201d \u201cAsk him!\u201d said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan\u2019s picture. \u201cAsk him if he saw \u2014\u201d Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated breath. \u201cSir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?\u201d \u201cCertainly, good lady!\u201d cried Sir Cadogan. There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside",
        "the common room. \u201cYou \u2014 you did?\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cBut \u2014 but the password!\u201d\u201cHe had \u2019em!\u201d said Sir Cadogan proudly. \u201cHad the whole week\u2019s, my lady! Read \u2019em off a little piece of paper!\u201d Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk. \u201cWhich person,\u201d she said, her voice shaking, \u201cwhich abysmally foolish person wrote down this week\u2019s passwords and left them lying around?\u201d There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy-slippered toes, raised his hand slowly into the air."

    "Chapter 14": [
        "Snape\u2019s Grudge No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped. Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was",
        "given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs. Harry couldn\u2019t help noticing that the statue of the one- eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they \u2014 and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione\u2014 were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it. \u201cD\u2019you reckon we should tell someone?\u201d Harry asked Ron. \u201cWe know he\u2019s not coming in through Honeyduke\u2019s,\u201d said Ron dismissively \u201cWe\u2019d\u2019ve heard if the shop had been broken into.\u201d Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again. Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in",
        "his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely shaken by the night\u2019s events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth of detail. \u201c\u2026 I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft \u2026 I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down. \u2026 I rolled over \u2026 and I saw him standing over me \u2026 like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair \u2026 holding this great long knife, must\u2019ve been twelve inches \u2026 and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered. \u201cWhy, though?\u201d Ron added to Harry as the group of second-year",
        "girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. \u201cWhy did he run?\u201d Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn\u2019t mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known he\u2019d have a job getting back out of the castle once you\u2019d yelled and woken people up,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019d\u2019ve had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole \u2026 then he would\u2019ve met the teachers. \u2026\u201dNeville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait",
        "outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black\u2019s break-in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast \u2014 a Howler. The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once \u2014 Ron had got one from his mother the year before. \u201cRun for it, Neville,\u201d Ron advised. Neville didn\u2019t need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the",
        "Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall \u2014 Neville\u2019s grandmother\u2019s voice, magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family. Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist. \u201cOuch! Oh \u2014 thanks, Hedwig.\u201d Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of Neville\u2019s cornflakes. The note inside said: Dear Harry and Ron, How about having tea with me this afternoon \u2019round six? I\u2019ll come and collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU\u2019RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN.Cheers, Hagrid \u201cHe probably wants to hear all about Black!\u201d said Ron. So at six o\u2019clock that afternoon, Harry and",
        "Ron left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall. Hagrid was already waiting for them. \u201cAll right, Hagrid!\u201d said Ron. \u201cS\u2019pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve already heard all abou\u2019 it,\u201d said Hagrid, opening the front doors and leading them outside. \u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, looking slightly put out. The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid\u2019s cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of Hagrid\u2019s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid\u2019s wardrobe door. \u201cWhat are they for, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry. \u201cBuckbeak\u2019s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o\u2019 Dangerous Creatures,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThis Friday. Him an\u2019",
        "me\u2019ll be goin\u2019 down ter London together. I\u2019ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. \u2026\u201d Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak\u2019s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron\u2019s face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak\u2019s defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds. Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid\u2019s cooking. \u201cI got somethin\u2019 ter discuss with you two,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHermione,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe\u2019s in a righ\u2019 state, that\u2019s what. She\u2019s bin comin\u2019 down ter visit me a lot since Chris\u2019mas. Bin feelin\u2019 lonely. Firs\u2019 yeh weren\u2019",
        "talking to her because o\u2019 the Firebolt, now yer not talkin\u2019 to her because her cat \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 ate Scabbers!\u201d Ron interjected angrily. \u201cBecause her cat acted like all cats do,\u201d Hagrid continued doggedly. \u201cShe\u2019s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin\u2019 through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more\u2019n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she\u2019s tryin\u2019 ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak\u2019s case, mind. \u2026 She\u2019s found some really good stuff fer me \u2026 reckon he\u2019ll stand a good chance now. \u2026\u201d \u201cHagrid, we should\u2019ve helped as well \u2014 sorry \u2014\u201d Harry began awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m not blamin\u2019 yeh!\u201d said Hagrid, waving Harry\u2019s apology aside. \u201cGawd knows yeh\u2019ve had enough ter be gettin\u2019 on with. I\u2019ve seen yeh practicin\u2019 Quidditch ev\u2019ry hour o\u2019 the day an\u2019 night \u2014 but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two\u2019d value",
        "yer friend more\u2019n broomsticks or rats. Tha\u2019s all.\u201d Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks. \u201cReally upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She\u2019s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an\u2019 you two not talkin\u2019 to her \u2014\u201d \u201cIf she\u2019d just get rid of that cat, I\u2019d speak to her again!\u201d Ron said angrily. \u201cBut she\u2019s still sticking up for it! It\u2019s a maniac, and she won\u2019t hear a word against it!\u201d \u201cAh, well, people can be a bit stupid abou\u2019 their pets,\u201d said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid\u2019s pillow. They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor\u2019s improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o\u2019clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle.A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room. \u201cHogsmeade, next weekend!\u201d said Ron, craning",
        "over the heads to read the new notice. \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon?\u201d he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down. \u201cWell, Filch hasn\u2019t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes. \u2026\u201d Harry said, even more quietly. \u201cHarry!\u201d said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her. \u201cHarry, if you go into Hogsmeade again \u2026 I\u2019ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cCan you hear someone talking, Harry?\u201d growled Ron, not looking at Hermione. \u201cRon, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I\u2019ll tell \u2014\u201d \u201cSo now you\u2019re trying to get Harry expelled!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cHaven\u2019t you done enough damage this year?\u201d Hermione opened her mouth",
        "to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron\u2019s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls\u2019 dormitories. \u201cSo how about it?\u201d Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. \u201cCome on, last time we went you didn\u2019t see anything. You haven\u2019t even been inside Zonko\u2019s yet!\u201d Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.\u201d On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder\u2019s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but heavoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded",
        "to the front doors. \u201c \u2019Bye!\u201d Harry called to Ron. \u201cSee you when you get back!\u201d Ron grinned and winked. Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder\u2019s Map out of his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom. Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, \u201cDissendium!\u201d and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner. \u201cHarry! I forgot you weren\u2019t going to Hogsmeade either!\u201d \u201cHi, Neville,\u201d said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket. \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d shrugged Neville. \u201cWant a game of Exploding Snap?\u201d \u201cEr \u2014 not now \u2014 I was going to go to the library and",
        "do that vampire essay for Lupin \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come with you!\u201d said Neville brightly. \u201cI haven\u2019t done it either!\u201d \u201cEr \u2014 hang on \u2014 yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!\u201d \u201cGreat, you can help me!\u201d said Neville, his round face anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that thing about the garlic at all \u2014 do they have to eat it, or \u2014\u201d He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry\u2019s shoulder. It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry. \u201cAnd what are you two doing here?\u201d said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other. \u201cAn odd place to meet \u2014\u201d To Harry\u2019s immense disquiet, Snape\u2019s black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch. \u201cWe\u2019re not \u2014 meeting here,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe just \u2014 met here.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Snape. \u201cYou have a habit",
        "of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason. \u2026 I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.\u201d Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch\u2019s head, examining it closely. Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password, then pretending he\u2019d left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose. The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office. He sprinted back to the one-eyed",
        "witch, opened her hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped the Marauder\u2019s Map blank again, then set off at a run. Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat kept you?\u201d Ron hissed. \u201cSnape was hanging around. \u2026\u201d They set off up the High Street. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cAre you still there? This feels weird. \u2026\u201d They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat hooting softlydown at him, at least three hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (\u201cLocal Deliveries Only\u201d),",
        "which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry\u2019s hand. Then they visited Zonko\u2019s, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak. They left Zonko\u2019s with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece. The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly",
        "creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden. \u201cEven the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,\u201d said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it. \u201cI asked Nearly Headless Nick \u2026 he says he\u2019s heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut. \u2026\u201d Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking. \u201c\u2026 should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm \u2026 about how I couldn\u2019t use it for three months. \u2026\u201d Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. \u201cI really",
        "wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself \u2026 \u2018There\u2019s no \u2019arm in \u2019im, \u2019onest \u2014\u2019 \u2026 that hippogriff\u2019s as good as dead \u2014\u201dMalfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent grin. \u201cWhat are you doing, Weasley?\u201d Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron. \u201cSuppose you\u2019d love to live here, wouldn\u2019t you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room \u2014 is that true?\u201d Harry seized the back of Ron\u2019s robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy. \u201cLeave him to me,\u201d he hissed in Ron\u2019s ear. The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path. \u201cWe were just discussing your friend Hagrid,\u201d Malfoy said to Ron. \u201cJust trying to imagine",
        "what he\u2019s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. D\u2019you think he\u2019ll cry when they cut off his hippogriff\u2019s \u2014\u201d SPLAT. Malfoy\u2019s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silver-blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck. \u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean. \u201cWhat was that? Who did that?\u201d \u201cVery haunted up here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron, with the air of one commenting on the weather. Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape. Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green sludge. SPLATTER. Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle",
        "hopped furiously on the spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.\u201cIt came from over there!\u201d said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of Harry. Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe\u2019s back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled \u2014 and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry\u2019s cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face. For a split second, Malfoy stared at him. \u201cAAARGH!\u201d he yelled, pointing at Harry\u2019s head. Then he turned tail and",
        "ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him. Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done. \u201cHarry!\u201d Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared, \u201cyou\u2019d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone \u2014 you\u2019d better get back to the castle, quick \u2014\u201d \u201cSee you later,\u201d said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade. Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe Malfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak \u2014 nobody except Dumbledore. Harry\u2019s stomach turned over \u2014 Dumbledore would know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said anything \u2014 Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor \u2014 Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage. \u2026 Malfoy would get",
        "back first \u2026 how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn\u2019t slow down until he reached the stone slide. He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher \u2014 he hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as hecould, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of the witch\u2019s hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from behind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching. It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes swishing, then stopped in front of him. \u201cSo,\u201d he said. There was a look of suppressed triumph about",
        "him. Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly hid in his pockets. \u201cCome with me, Potter,\u201d said Snape. Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape\u2019s office. Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious trouble then too. Snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere. \u201cSit,\u201d said Snape. Harry sat. Snape, however, remained standing. \u201cMr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,\u201d said Snape. Harry didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cHe tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack",
        "when he ran into Weasley \u2014 apparently alone.\u201d Still, Harry didn\u2019t speak. \u201cMr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?\u201d Harry tried to look mildly surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Professor.\u201d Snape\u2019s eyes were boring into Harry\u2019s. It was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\u201cMr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious. \u201cIt was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\u201d There was a long silence. \u201cMaybe he\u2019d better go to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIf he\u2019s seeing things like \u2014\u201d \u201cWhat would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\u201d said Snape softly. \u201cYour head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part",
        "of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.\u201d \u201cI know that,\u201d said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. \u201cIt sounds like Malfoy\u2019s having hallucin \u2014\u201d \u201cMalfoy is not having hallucinations,\u201d snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry\u2019s chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. \u201cIf your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike you told \u2014\u201d \u201cCan anyone confirm that?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t say anything. Snape\u2019s thin mouth curled into a horrible smile. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, straightening up again. \u201cEveryone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no",
        "thought for the consequences.\u201d Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth. He wasn\u2019t going to do it. Snape had no proof \u2014 yet. \u201cHow extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\u201d Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. \u201cHe too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers \u2026 The resemblance between you is uncanny.\u201d\u201cMy dad didn\u2019t strut,\u201d said Harry, before he could stop himself. \u201cAnd neither do I.\u201d \u201cYour father didn\u2019t set much store by rules either,\u201d Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \u201cRules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen \u2014\u201d \u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt",
        "since his last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn\u2019t care that Snape\u2019s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously. \u201cWhat did you say to me, Potter?\u201d \u201cI told you to shut up about my dad!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cI know the truth, all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn\u2019t even be here if it wasn\u2019t for my dad!\u201d Snape\u2019s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk. \u201cAnd did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?\u201d he whispered. \u201cOr did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter\u2019s delicate ears?\u201d Harry bit his lip. He didn\u2019t know what had happened and didn\u2019t want to admit it \u2014 but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth. \u201cI would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter,\u201d he said,",
        "a terrible grin twisting his face. \u201cHave you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you \u2014 your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn\u2019t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.\u201d Snape\u2019s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared. \u201cTurn out your pockets, Potter!\u201d he spat suddenly. Harry didn\u2019t move. There was a pounding in his ears.\u201cTurn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!\u201d Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko\u2019s tricks and the Marauder\u2019s Map. Snape picked up the Zonko\u2019s bag. \u201cRon gave them to me,\u201d said Harry, praying he\u2019d",
        "get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. \u201cHe \u2014 brought them back from Hogsmeade last time \u2014\u201d \u201cIndeed? And you\u2019ve been carrying them around ever since? How very touching \u2026 and what is this?\u201d Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive. \u201cSpare bit of parchment,\u201d he said with a shrug. Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t need such a very old piece of parchment?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just \u2014 throw this away?\u201d His hand moved toward the fire. \u201cNo!\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cSo!\u201d said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. \u201cIs this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it \u2014 something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or \u2014 instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?\u201d Harry blinked. Snape\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cLet me see,",
        "let me see \u2026 ,\u201d he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. \u201cReveal your secret!\u201d he said, touching the wand to the parchment. Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking. \u201cShow yourself!\u201d Snape said, tapping the map sharply. It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths. \u201cProfessor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!\u201d Snape said, hitting the map with his wand. As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.\u201cMr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people\u2019s business.\u201d Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map didn\u2019t stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first. \u201cMr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like",
        "to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.\u201d It would have been very funny if the situation hadn\u2019t been so serious. And there was more. \u2026 \u201cMr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.\u201d Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he\u2019d opened them, the map had had its last word. \u201cMr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.\u201d Harry waited for the blow to fall. \u201cSo \u2026 ,\u201d said Snape softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about this. \u2026\u201d He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames. \u201cLupin!\u201d Snape called into the fire. \u201cI want a word!\u201d Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin",
        "was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes. \u201cYou called, Severus?\u201d said Lupin mildly. \u201cI certainly did,\u201d said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. \u201cI have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.\u201d Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin\u2019s face. \u201cWell?\u201d said Snape. Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.\u201cWell?\u201d said Snape again. \u201cThis parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?\u201d Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry\u2019s direction, warned him not to interrupt. \u201cFull of Dark Magic?\u201d he repeated mildly.",
        "\u201cDo you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop \u2014\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. \u201cYou think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don\u2019t think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin. \u201cYou mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?\u201d he said. \u201cHarry, do you know any of these men?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cYou see, Severus?\u201d said Lupin, turning back to Snape. \u201cIt looks like a Zonko product to me \u2014\u201d Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out of breath, and stopped just short of",
        "Snape\u2019s desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak. \u201cI \u2014 gave \u2014 Harry \u2014 that \u2014 stuff,\u201d he choked. \u201cBought \u2014 it \u2026 in Zonko\u2019s \u2026 ages \u2014 ago \u2026\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. \u201cThat seems to clear that up! Severus, I\u2019ll take this back, shall I?\u201d He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. \u201cHarry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay \u2014 excuse us, Severus \u2014\u201d Harry didn\u2019t dare look at Snape as they left his office. He, Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin. \u201cProfessor, I \u2014\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear explanations,\u201d said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. \u201cI happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr.",
        "Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it\u2019s a map,\u201d he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn\u2019t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can\u2019t let you have it back, Harry.\u201d Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest. \u201cWhy did Snape think I\u2019d got it from the manufacturers?\u201d \u201cBecause \u2026 ,\u201d Lupin hesitated, \u201cbecause these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They\u2019d think it extremely entertaining.\u201d \u201cDo you know them?\u201d said Harry, impressed. \u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I",
        "would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them \u2014 gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.\u201d He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape\u2019s office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one- eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak \u2014 it was still down there, but he didn\u2019t dare go and get it. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d said Ron abruptly. \u201cI persuaded you to go. Lupin\u2019s right, it was stupid, we shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve done it \u2014\u201d He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face convinced Harry that she",
        "had heard what had happened. His heart plummeted \u2014 had she told Professor McGonagall?\u201cCome to have a good gloat?\u201d said Ron savagely as she stopped in front of them. \u201cOr have you just been to tell on us?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling. \u201cI just thought you ought to know \u2026 Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.\u201d"

        "The Quidditch Final \u201cHe \u2014 he sent me this,\u201d Hermione said, holding out the letter. Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read. Dear Hermione, We lost. I\u2019m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts. Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won\u2019t forget all the help you gave us. Hagrid \u201cThey can\u2019t do this,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey can\u2019t. Buckbeak isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cMalfoy\u2019s dad\u2019s frightened the Committee into it,\u201d said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \u201cYou know what he\u2019s like. They\u2019re a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There\u2019ll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can\u2019t see any hope. \u2026 Nothing will have changed.\u201d \u201cYeah, it will,\u201d said Ron fiercely. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione.

        "Ron!\u201dHermione flung her arms around Ron\u2019s neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away. \u201cRon, I\u2019m really, really sorry about Scabbers \u2026 ,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cOh \u2014 well \u2014 he was old,\u201d said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. \u201cAnd he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.\u201d The safety measures imposed on the students since Black\u2019s second break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. He seemed numb with shock at the verdict. \u201cS\u2019all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin\u2019 there in black robes an\u2019 I kep\u2019 droppin\u2019 me notes and forgettin\u2019 all them",

Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively. \u201cS\u2019no good, Ron,\u201d said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \u201cThat Committee\u2019s in Lucius Malfoy\u2019s pocket.

        "quite as pathetic?\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cAnd he\u2019s supposed to be our teacher!\u201d Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first \u2014 SMACK! She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul \u2014 you evil \u2014\u201d \u201cHermione!\u201d said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back. \u201cGet off, Ron!\u201d Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons. \u201cHermione!\u201d Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed. \u201cHarry, you\u2019d better beat him in the Quidditch final!\u201d Hermione said shrilly. \u201cYou just better had,",
        "because I can\u2019t stand it if Slytherin wins!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re due in Charms,\u201d said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019d better go.\u201d They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick\u2019s classroom. \u201cYou\u2019re late, boys!\u201d said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \u201cCome along, quickly, wands out, we\u2019re experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we\u2019ve already divided into pairs \u2014\u201d Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hermione gone?\u201d Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn\u2019t entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to himwhen he had opened the door. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d said Harry, staring at Ron. \u201cMaybe \u2014 maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\u201d But Hermione didn\u2019t turn up all lesson. \u201cShe could\u2019ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\u201d said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning",
        "broadly \u2014 the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment. Hermione wasn\u2019t at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Malfoy did something to her?\u201d Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\u201cFlibbertigibbet\u201d), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room. Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake. \u201cWh \u2014 what?\u201d said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \u201cIs it time to go? W \u2014 which lesson have we got now? \u201cDivination, but it\u2019s not for another twenty",
        "minutes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHermione, why didn\u2019t you come to Charms?\u201d \u201cWhat? Oh no!\u201d Hermione squeaked. \u201cI forgot to go to Charms!\u201d \u201cBut how could you forget?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Hermione wailed. \u201cWas Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\u201d \u201cYou know what, Hermione?\u201d said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \u201cI reckon you\u2019re cracking up. You\u2019re trying to do too much.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \u201cI just made a mistake, that\u2019s all! I\u2019d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. \u2026 I\u2019ll see you in Divination!\u201d Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney\u2019s classroom twenty",
        "minutes later, looking extremely harassed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\u201d Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table. \u201cI thought we weren\u2019t starting crystal balls until next term,\u201d Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby. \u201cDon\u2019t complain, this means we\u2019ve finished palmistry,\u201d Harry muttered back. \u201cI was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\u201d \u201cGood day to you!\u201d said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal",
        "ball. \u201cI have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \u201cThe fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\u201d Hermione snorted. \u201cWell, honestly \u2026 \u2018the fates have informed her\u2019 \u2026 who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\u201d she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs. It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. Shecontinued, however, as though she had not. \u201cCrystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\u201d she said dreamily. \u201cI do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb\u2019s infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind",
        "and external eyes\u201d \u2014 Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise \u2014 \u201cso as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.\u201d And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as \u201cthis is stupid\u201d kept drifting across it. It didn\u2019t help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting. \u201cSeen anything yet?\u201d Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour\u2019s quiet crystal gazing. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a burn on this table,\u201d said Ron, pointing. \u201cSomeone\u2019s spilled their candle.\u201d \u201cThis is such a waste of time,\u201d Hermione hissed. \u201cI could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms \u2014\u201d Professor",
        "Trelawney rustled past. \u201cWould anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?\u201d she murmured over the clinking of her bangles. \u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d Ron whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious what this means. There\u2019s going to be loads of fog tonight.\u201d Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. \u201cNow, really!\u201d said Professor Trelawney as everyone\u2019s heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \u201cYou are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\u201d She approached their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming \u2014 \u201cThere is something here!\u201d Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it wasreflected twice in her huge glasses. \u201cSomething moving \u2026 but what is it?\u201d Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn\u2019t good news, whatever it was. And sure enough",
        "\u2014 \u201cMy dear \u2026 ,\u201d Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \u201cIt is here, plainer than ever before \u2026 my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer \u2026 the Gr \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d said Hermione loudly. \u201cNot that ridiculous Grim again!\u201d Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione\u2019s face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger. \u201cI am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don\u2019t remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\u201d There was a moment\u2019s silence. Then \u2014 \u201cFine!\u201d said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag. \u201cFine!\u201d she repeated, swinging the bag over",
        "her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \u201cI give up! I\u2019m leaving!\u201d And to the whole class\u2019s amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron\u2019s table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her. \u201cOoooo!\u201d said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \u201cOooooo, Professor Trelawney, I\u2019ve just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn\u2019t you? Didn\u2019t you, Professor? \u2018Around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever!\u2019 You said it ages ago, Professor!\u201dProfessor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. \u201cYes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs. \u2026 The",
        "Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. \u2026\u201d Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead. \u201cSome day Hermione\u2019s having, eh?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed. \u201cYeah \u2026\u201d Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer. The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn\u2019t the only one. \u201cCall this a holiday!\u201d Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. \u201cThe exams are ages away, what\u2019re they playing at?\u201d But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she was taking more subjects than anybody",
        "else. She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin\u2019s under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak\u2019s appeal. When he wasn\u2019t doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks.Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the match by more than that",
        "amount to win the Cup. It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. \u201cSo you must catch it only if we\u2019re more than fifty points up,\u201d Wood told Harry constantly. \u201cOnly if we\u2019re more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You\u2019ve got that, haven\u2019t you? You must catch the Snitch only if we\u2019re \u2014\u201d \u201cI KNOW, OLIVER!\u201d Harry yelled. The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match. Gryffindor hadn\u2019t won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron\u2019s second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade",
        "and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. Harry hadn\u2019t forgotten Malfoy\u2019s attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. Never, in anyone\u2019s memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth yearended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears. Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn\u2019t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle",
        "kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt\u2019s safety than his own. When he wasn\u2019t flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there. All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match. Even Hermione had put down her books. \u201cI can\u2019t work, I can\u2019t concentrate,\u201d she said nervously. There was a great deal",
        "of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a Firebolt!\u201d said Ron. \u201cYeah \u2026 ,\u201d said Harry, his stomach writhing.It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \u201cTeam! Bed!\u201d Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and",
        "that Wood was yelling, \u201cWhere were you? We had to use Neville instead!\u201d Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy\u2019s steed\u2019s mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start. It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn\u2019t taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window. The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was",
        "motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect. Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn. Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn\u2019t be the Grim \u2014 not now \u2014 not right before the match \u2014 He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute\u2019s frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t the Grim at all \u2026 it was a cat. \u2026 Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks. \u2026 Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks",
        "seemed to havecome to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too. And just then, it emerged \u2014 a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry\u2019s death? \u201cRon!\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cRon! Wake up!\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cI need you to tell me if you can see something!\u201d \u201cS\u2019all dark, Harry,\u201d Ron muttered thickly. \u201cWhat\u2019re you on about?\u201d \u201cDown here \u2014\u201d Harry looked quickly back out of the window. Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren\u2019t there. Where had they gone? A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again. Harry and the rest of the",
        "Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn\u2019t help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual. Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again. \u201cGood luck, Harry!\u201d called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing. \u201cOkay \u2014 no wind to speak of \u2014 sun\u2019s a bit bright, that could impair your vision, watch out for it \u2014 ground\u2019s fairly hard, good, that\u2019ll give us a fast kickoff \u2014\u201d Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw",
        "the front doors of the castleopen in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn. \u201cLocker rooms,\u201d said Wood tersely. None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he\u2019d eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s time, let\u2019s go \u2014\u201d They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \u201cGO GRYFFINDOR!\u201d and \u201cLIONS FOR THE CUP!\u201d Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very",
        "grim smile. \u201cAnd here are the Gryffindors!\u201d yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \u201cPotter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years \u2014\u201d Lee\u2019s comments were drowned by a tide of \u201cboos\u201d from the Slytherin end. \u201cAnd here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He\u2019s made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill \u2014\u201d More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous. \u201cCaptains, shake hands!\u201d said Madam Hooch. Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other\u2019s hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other\u2019s fingers. \u201cMount your brooms!\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cThree \u2026 two",
        "\u2026 one \u2026\u201dThe sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no \u2014 Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field \u2014 WHAM! \u2014 nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it\u2019s caught by \u2014 Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina \u2014 nice swerve around Montague \u2014 duck, Angelina, that\u2019s a Bludger! \u2014 SHE SCORES!

Flint\u2019s nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed. \u201cThat will do!\u201d shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between them. \u201cPenalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\u201d \u201cCome off it, Miss!\u201d howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty. \u201cCome on, Alicia!\u201d yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. \u201cYES! SHE\u2019S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY\u2013ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\u201d Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to",
        "take the Slytherin penalty.Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched. \u201c \u2019Course, Wood\u2019s a superb Keeper!\u201d Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle. \u201cSuperb! Very difficult to pass \u2014 very difficult indeed \u2014 YES! I DON\u2019T BELIEVE IT! HE\u2019S SAVED IT!\u201d Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee\u2019s commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up \u2014 \u201cGryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession \u2014 no! \u2014 Gryffindor back in possession and it\u2019s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she\u2019s streaking up the field \u2014 THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\u201d Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air,",
        "managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle. Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker. \u201cTHIRTY\u2013ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING \u2014\u201d \u201cJordan, if you can\u2019t commentate in an unbiased way \u2014 !\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling it like it is, Professor!\u201d Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch \u2014 it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts \u2014 but he mustn\u2019t catch it yet \u2014 and if Malfoy saw it \u2014 Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end \u2014 it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. \u2026 WHOOSH. One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry\u2019s right ear,",
        "hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again \u2014 WHOOSH.The second Bludger grazed Harry\u2019s elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in. Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised \u2014 He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch. \u201cHa haaa!\u201d yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \u201cToo bad, boys! You\u2019ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it\u2019s Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle \u2014 Flint alongside her \u2014 poke him in the eye, Angelina! \u2014 it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke \u2014 oh no \u2014 Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save \u2014 !\u201d But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of",
        "cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him. \u201cSorry, Professor, sorry! Won\u2019t happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession \u2014\u201d It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he\u2019d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor. The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it \u2014 once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead \u2014 Katie",
        "scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, oneafter the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. Madam Hooch was beside herself. \u201cYOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!\u201d she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \u201cGryffindor penalty!\u201d And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal \u2014 seventy-ten. The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse \u2014 Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds",
        "of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him. And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him. Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down \u2014 Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt\u2019s tail, and was pulling it back. \u201cYou \u2014\u201d Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn\u2019t reach \u2014 Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he\u2019d wanted to do \u2014 the Snitch had disappeared again. \u201cPenalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I\u2019ve never seen such tactics!\u201d Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his",
        "Nimbus Two Thousand and One. \u201cYOU CHEATING SCUM!\u201d Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall\u2019s reach. \u201cYOU FILTHY, CHEATING B \u2014\u201dProfessor McGonagall didn\u2019t even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy\u2019s direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously. Alicia took Gryffindor\u2019s penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy\u2019s foul on Harry, were being spurred on to greater heights. \u201cSlytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal \u2014 Montague scores \u2014\u201d Lee groaned. \u201cSeventy-twenty to Gryffindor. \u2026\u201d Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn\u2019t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. \u2026 \u201cGet out of it, Potter!\u201d Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.",
        "\u201cAngelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\u201d Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper \u2014 they were all going to block her \u2014 Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins. \u201cAAAAAAARRRGH!\u201d They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina\u2019s way was clear. \u201cSHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!\u201d Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field. And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face \u2014 there, a few feet above the grass below, was a",
        "tiny, golden glimmer \u2014Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead \u2014 \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy \u2014 Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him \u2014 he was at Malfoy\u2019s ankles \u2014 he was level \u2014 Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy\u2019s arm out of the way and \u2014 \u201cYES!\u201d He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina\u2019s,",
        "Alicia\u2019s, and Katie\u2019s voices, \u201cWe\u2019ve won the Cup! We\u2019ve won the Cup!\u201d Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth. Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes \u2014 \u201cYeh beat \u2019em, Harry, yeh beat \u2019em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak!\u201d There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was",
        "borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. If only there had been a dementor around. \u2026 As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into theair, Harry felt he could have produced the world\u2019s best Patronus."

    "Chapter 16": [
        "Professor Trelawney\u2019s Prediction Harry\u2019s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake. But they couldn\u2019t. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the",
        "highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione. Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once, but theycouldn\u2019t restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column read: Monday 9 o\u2019clock, Arithmancy 9 o\u2019clock, Transfiguration Lunch 1 o\u2019clock, Charms 1 o\u2019clock, Ancient Runes \u201cHermione?\u201d Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days. \u201cEr \u2014 are you sure you\u2019ve copied down these times right?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it. \u201cYes, of course I have.\u201d \u201cIs there any",
        "point asking how you\u2019re going to sit for two exams at once?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione shortly. \u201cHave either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\u201d said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for the book. Just then, there was a rustle at the window and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight in her beak. \u201cIt\u2019s from Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, ripping the note open. \u201cBuckbeak\u2019s appeal \u2014 it\u2019s set for the sixth.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the day we finish our exams,\u201d said Hermione, still looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book. \u201cAnd they\u2019re coming up here to do it,\u201d said Harry, still reading from the letter. \u201cSomeone from the Ministry of Magic and \u2014 and an executioner.\u201d Hermione looked up, startled. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing the executioner to the appeal!",
        "But that sounds as though they\u2019ve already decided!\u201d \u201cYeah, it does,\u201d said Harry slowly.\u201cThey can\u2019t!\u201d Ron howled. \u201cI\u2019ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can\u2019t just ignore it all!\u201d But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had been noticeably subdued since Gryffindor\u2019s triumph in the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his old swagger over the next few days. From sneering comments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about. It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these occasions. And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid, because the strict",
        "new security measures had not been lifted, and Harry didn\u2019t dare retrieve his Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch. * * * Exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over the castle. The third years emerged from Transfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the difficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had included turning a teapot into a tortoise. Hermione irritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of everyone else\u2019s worries. \u201cMine still had a spout for a tail, what a nightmare. \u2026\u201d \u201cWere the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?\u201d \u201cIt still had a willow-patterned shell, d\u2019you think that\u2019ll count against me?\u201d Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on Cheering",
        "Charms. Harry slightly overdid his out of nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of hysterical laughter andhad to be led away to a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself. After dinner, the students hurried back to their common rooms, not to relax, but to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures, Potions, and Astronomy. Hagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures exam the following morning with a very preoccupied air indeed; his heart didn\u2019t seem to be in it at all. He had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the class, and told them that to pass the test, their flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one hour. As flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had ever taken, and",
        "also gave Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid. \u201cBeaky\u2019s gettin\u2019 a bit depressed,\u201d Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry\u2019s flobberworm was still alive. \u201cBin cooped up too long. But still \u2026 we\u2019ll know day after tomorrow \u2014 one way or the other \u2014\u201d They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn\u2019t get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away. Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue\u2019s choco-nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant",
        "Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over. Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin hadcompiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart. \u201cExcellent, Harry,\u201d Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk, grinning. \u201cFull marks.\u201d Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached",
        "the hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming. \u201cHermione!\u201d said Lupin, startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cP \u2014 P \u2014 Professor McGonagall!\u201d Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \u201cSh \u2014 she said I\u2019d failed everything!\u201d It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione\u2019s boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps. Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry. \u201cHello there, Harry!\u201d he said. \u201cJust had an exam,",
        "I expect? Nearly finished?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background. \u201cLovely day,\u201d said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. \u201cPity \u2026 pity \u2026\u201d He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\u201cI\u2019m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.\u201d \u201cDoes that mean the appeal\u2019s already happened?\u201d Ron interrupted, stepping forward. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s scheduled for this afternoon,\u201d said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron. \u201cThen you might not have to witness an execution at all!\u201d said Ron stoutly. \u201cThe hippogriff might get off!\u201d Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he",
        "appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin black mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid\u2019s cabin and said in a feeble voice, \u201cDear, dear, I\u2019m getting too old for this. \u2026 Two o\u2019clock, isn\u2019t it, Fudge?\u201d The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall. \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop me?\u201d said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \u201cDid you see them? They\u2019ve even got the axe ready! This isn\u2019t justice!\u201d \u201cRon, your dad works for the Ministry, you can\u2019t",
        "go saying things like that to his boss!\u201d said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \u201cAs long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argues his case properly, they can\u2019t possibly execute Buckbeak. \u2026\u201d But Harry could tell Hermione didn\u2019t really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, andHermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn\u2019t join in. Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s last exam was Divination; Hermione\u2019s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney\u2019s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying. \u201cShe\u2019s seeing us all separately,\u201d Neville informed",
        "them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \u201cHave either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?\u201d he asked them unhappily. \u201cNope,\u201d said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak\u2019s appeal started. The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \u201cWhat did she ask? Was it okay?\u201d But they all refused to say. \u201cShe says the crystal ball\u2019s told her that if I tell you, I\u2019ll have a horrible accident!\u201d squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing. \u201cThat\u2019s convenient,\u201d snorted Ron. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m",
        "starting to think Hermione was right about her\u201d \u2014 he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead \u2014 \u201cshe\u2019s a right old fraud.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was now two o\u2019clock. \u201cWish she\u2019d hurry up \u2026\u201d Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride. \u201cShe says I\u2019ve got all the makings of a true Seer,\u201d she informed Harry and Ron. \u201cI saw loads of stuff. \u2026 Well, good luck!\u201dShe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender. \u201cRonald Weasley,\u201d said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid. Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron\u2019s",
        "large feet reappeared on the ladder. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Harry asked him, standing up. \u201cRubbish,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCouldn\u2019t see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don\u2019t think she was convinced, though. \u2026\u201d \u201cMeet you in the common room,\u201d Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney\u2019s voice called, \u201cHarry Potter!\u201d The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball. \u201cGood day, my dear,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIf you would kindly gaze into the Orb. \u2026 Take your time, now \u2026 then tell me what you see within it. \u2026\u201d Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white",
        "fog, but nothing happened. \u201cWell?\u201d Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend. \u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry, \u201ca dark shape \u2026 um \u2026\u201d \u201cWhat does it resemble?\u201d whispered Professor Trelawney. \u201cThink, now \u2026\u201d Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak. \u201cA hippogriff,\u201d he said firmly.\u201cIndeed!\u201d whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. \u201cMy boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid\u2019s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer. \u2026 Does the hippogriff appear to \u2026 have its head?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry firmly. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Professor Trelawney urged him. \u201cAre you quite sure, dear? You don\u2019t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure",
        "raising an axe behind it?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick. \u201cNo blood? No weeping Hagrid?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat. \u201cIt looks fine, it\u2019s \u2014 flying away. \u2026\u201d Professor Trelawney sighed. \u201cWell, dear, I think we\u2019ll leave it there. \u2026 A little disappointing \u2026 but I\u2019m sure you did your best.\u201d Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him. \u201cIt will happen tonight.\u201d Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging. \u201cS \u2014 sorry?\u201d said Harry. But Professor Trelawney didn\u2019t seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running",
        "to the hospital wing \u2014 and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own: \u201cThe Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight \u2026 the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant\u2019s aid, greater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight \u2026 before midnight \u2026 the servant \u2026 will set out \u2026 to rejoin \u2026 his master. \u2026\u201dProfessor Trelawney\u2019s head fell forward onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor Trelawney\u2019s head snapped up again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, dear boy,\u201d she said dreamily, \u201cthe heat of the day, you know \u2026 I drifted off for a moment. \u2026\u201d Harry sat there, staring at her. \u201cIs",
        "there anything wrong, my dear?\u201d \u201cYou \u2014 you just told me that the \u2014 the Dark Lord\u2019s going to rise again \u2026 that his servant\u2019s going to go back to him. \u2026\u201d Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled. \u201cThe Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that\u2019s hardly something to joke about. \u2026 Rise again, indeed \u2014\u201d \u201cBut you just said it! You said the Dark Lord \u2014\u201d \u201cI think you must have dozed off too, dear!\u201d said Professor Trelawney. \u201cI would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that!\u201d Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, wondering \u2026 had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test? Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney\u2019s words still resounding in his head.",
        "People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione. \u201cProfessor Trelawney,\u201d Harry panted, \u201cjust told me \u2014\u201d But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces. \u201cBuckbeak lost,\u201d said Ron weakly. \u201cHagrid\u2019s just sent this.\u201d Hagrid\u2019s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrotethat it was hardly legible. Lost appeal. They\u2019re going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do. Don\u2019t come down. I don\u2019t want you to see it. Hagrid \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cHe can\u2019t just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner!\u201d \u201cSunset, though,\u201d said Ron,",
        "who was staring out the window in a glazed sort of way. \u201cWe\u2019d never be allowed \u2026 \u2019specially you, Harry. \u2026\u201d Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking. \u201cIf we only had the Invisibility Cloak. \u2026\u201d \u201cWhere is it?\u201d said Hermione. Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch. \u201c\u2026 if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I\u2019m in serious trouble,\u201d he finished. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Hermione, getting to her feet. \u201cIf he sees you. \u2026 How do you open the witch\u2019s hump again?\u201d \u201cYou \u2014 you tap it and say, \u2018Dissendium,\u2019 \u201d said Harry. \u201cBut \u2014\u201d Hermione didn\u2019t wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady\u2019s portrait and vanished from sight. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t gone to get it?\u201d Ron said, staring after her. She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with",
        "the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes. \u201cHermione, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you lately!\u201d said Ron, astounded. \u201cFirst you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney \u2014\u201d Hermione looked rather flattered. They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he had to keep hisarms folded to hide the lump. They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, \u201cno one there \u2014 cloak on \u2014\u201d Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into",
        "the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees. They reached Hagrid\u2019s cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s us,\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\u201d \u201cYeh shouldn\u2019ve come!\u201d Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak. Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears. \u201cWan\u2019 some tea?\u201d he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle. \u201cWhere\u2019s Buckbeak, Hagrid?\u201d said Hermione hesitantly. \u201cI \u2014 I took him outside,\u201d",
        "said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug. \u201cHe\u2019s tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees an\u2019 \u2014 an\u2019 smell fresh air \u2014 before \u2014\u201d Hagrid\u2019s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess. \u201cThere\u2019s another one in the cupboard,\u201d Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?\u201d Harry asked fiercely, sitting down next to him. \u201cDumbledore \u2014\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s tried,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHe\u2019s got no power ter overrule the Committee. He told \u2019em Buckbeak\u2019s all right, but they\u2019re scared. \u2026 Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy\u2019s like \u2026 threatened \u2019em, I expect \u2026 an\u2019 the executioner, Macnair, he\u2019s",

His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s gonna come down while it \u2014 while it happens. Wrote me this mornin\u2019. Said he wants ter \u2014 ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. \u2026\u201d Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid\u2019s cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in her hands, fighting back tears. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay with you too, Hagrid,\u201d she began, but Hagrid shook his shaggy head. \u201cYeh\u2019re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don\u2019 wan\u2019 yeh watchin\u2019. An\u2019 yeh shouldn\u2019 be down here anyway. \u2026 If Fudge an\u2019 Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh\u2019ll be in big",
        "trouble.\u201d Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione\u2019s face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek. \u201cRon! I \u2014 I don\u2019t believe it \u2014 it\u2019s Scabbers!\u201d Ron gaped at her. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table. \u201cScabbers!\u201d said Ron blankly. \u201cScabbers, what are you doing here?\u201dHe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron\u2019s hands as though desperate to free himself. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Scabbers!\u201d said Ron. \u201cNo cats!",
        "There\u2019s nothing here to hurt you!\u201d Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment. \u201cThey\u2019re comin\u2019. \u2026\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner, Macnair. \u201cYeh gotta go,\u201d said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. \u201cThey mustn\u2019 find yeh here. \u2026 Go now. \u2026\u201d Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak. \u201cI\u2019ll let yeh out the back way,\u201d said Hagrid. They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid\u2019s",
        "pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Beaky,\u201d said Hagrid softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay \u2026\u201d He turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cGet goin\u2019.\u201d But they didn\u2019t move. \u201cHagrid, we can\u2019t \u2014\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll tell them what really happened \u2014\u201d \u201cThey can\u2019t kill him \u2014\u201d \u201cGo!\u201d said Hagrid fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough without you lot in trouble an\u2019 all!\u201dThey had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight. \u201cGo quick,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cDon\u2019 listen. \u2026\u201d And he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door. Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid\u2019s",
        "house. As they reached the other side, the front door closed with a sharp snap. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s hurry,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it, I can\u2019t bear it. \u2026\u201d They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was a ruby-red glow. Ron stopped dead. \u201cOh, please, Ron,\u201d Hermione began. \u201cIt\u2019s Scabbers \u2014 he won\u2019t \u2014 stay put \u2014\u201d Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth into Ron\u2019s hand. \u201cScabbers, it\u2019s me, you idiot, it\u2019s Ron,\u201d Ron hissed. They heard a door open behind them and men\u2019s voices. \u201cOh, Ron, please let\u2019s move, they\u2019re going to do it!\u201d Hermione breathed. \u201cOkay \u2014 Scabbers, stay put \u2014\u201d They walked forward; Harry,",
        "like Hermione, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again. \u201cI can\u2019t hold him \u2014 Scabbers, shut up, everyone\u2019ll hear us \u2014\u201d The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid\u2019s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then,without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe. Hermione swayed on the spot. \u201cThey did it!\u201d she whispered to Harry. \u201cI d \u2014 don\u2019t believe it \u2014 they did it!\u201d"

    "Chapter 17": [
        "Cat, Rat, and Dog Harry\u2019s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long-shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling. \u201cHagrid,\u201d Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms. \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d said Ron, who was paper-white. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in worse trouble if they know we\u2019ve been to see him. \u2026\u201d Hermione\u2019s breathing was shallow and uneven. \u201cHow \u2014 could \u2014 they?\u201d she choked. \u201cHow could they?\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering. They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now. By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling",
        "like a spell around them. \u201cScabbers, keep still,\u201d Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, you stupid rat? Stay still \u2014 OUCH! He bit me!\u201d\u201cRon, be quiet!\u201d Hermione whispered urgently. \u201cFudge\u2019ll be out here in a minute \u2014\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t \u2014 stay \u2014 put \u2014\u201d Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron\u2019s grip. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d But Harry had just seen \u2014 slinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness \u2014 Crookshanks. Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers\u2019s squeaks, Harry couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cCrookshanks!\u201d Hermione moaned. \u201cNo, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!\u201d But the cat was getting nearer \u2014",
        "\u201cScabbers \u2014 NO!\u201d Too late \u2014 the rat had slipped between Ron\u2019s clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness. \u201cRon!\u201d Hermione moaned. She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks. \u201cGet away from him \u2014 get away \u2014 Scabbers, come here \u2014\u201d There was a loud thud. \u201cGotcha! Get off, you stinking cat \u2014\u201d Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the",
        "ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump. \u201cRon \u2014 come on \u2014 back under the cloak \u2014\u201d Hermione panted. \u201cDumbledore \u2014 the Minister \u2014 they\u2019ll be coming back out in a minute \u2014\u201dBut before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws. \u2026 Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow \u2014 an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog. Harry reached for his wand, but too late \u2014 the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth \u2014 But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to",
        "stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack. Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog\u2019s jaws fastened instead around Ron\u2019s outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute\u2019s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll \u2014 Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too. Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes \u2014 \u201cLumos!\u201d he whispered. The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going",
        "nearer. And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots \u2014 Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight \u2014 \u201cRon!\u201d Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again. All they could see now was one of Ron\u2019s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog frompulling him farther underground \u2014 but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron\u2019s leg had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight. \u201cHarry \u2014 we\u2019ve got to go for help \u2014\u201d Hermione gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder. \u201cNo! That thing\u2019s big enough to eat him; we haven\u2019t got time \u2014\u201d \u201cHarry \u2014 we\u2019re",
        "never going to get through without help \u2014\u201d Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles. \u201cIf that dog can get in, we can,\u201d Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn\u2019t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree\u2019s blows. \u201cOh, help, help,\u201d Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, \u201cplease \u2026\u201d Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk. Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook. \u201cCrookshanks!\u201d Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry\u2019s arm painfully hard. \u201cHow did he know \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s friends with that dog,\u201d said Harry grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them together. Come on \u2014 and keep",
        "your wand out \u2014\u201d They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry\u2019s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ron?\u201d she whispered in a terrified voice.\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks. \u201cWhere does this tunnel come out?\u201d Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. \u2026 It\u2019s marked on the Marauder\u2019s Map but Fred and George said no one\u2019s ever gotten into it. \u2026 It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade. \u2026\u201d They moved as fast",
        "as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks\u2019s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes. \u2026 All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him. \u2026 He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch. \u2026 And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening. He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond. It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all",
        "boarded up. Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded. Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry\u2019s arm again. Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows. \u201cHarry,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI think we\u2019re in the Shrieking Shack.\u201d Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely. \u201cGhosts didn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said slowly.At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had moved upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione\u2019s grip on Harry\u2019s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go. Quietly as they could, they",
        "crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs. They reached the dark landing. \u201cNox,\u201d they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod. Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open. On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron. Harry and Hermione dashed across to him. \u201cRon \u2014 are you okay?\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the dog?\u201d \u201cNot a",
        "dog,\u201d Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. \u201cHarry, it\u2019s a trap \u2014\u201d \u201cWhat \u2014\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the dog \u2026 he\u2019s an Animagus. \u2026\u201d Ron was staring over Harry\u2019s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them. A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn\u2019t been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black. \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d he croaked, pointing Ron\u2019s wand at them.Harry\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come and help your friend,\u201d he said hoarsely.",
        "His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it. \u201cYour father would have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run for a teacher. I\u2019m grateful \u2026 it will make everything much easier. \u2026\u201d The taunt about his father rang in Harry\u2019s ears as though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry\u2019s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack \u2026 to kill. Without knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back. \u2026 \u201cNo, Harry!\u201d Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black. \u201cIf you want to kill Harry, you\u2019ll have to kill",
        "us too!\u201d he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke. Something flickered in Black\u2019s shadowed eyes. \u201cLie down,\u201d he said quietly to Ron. \u201cYou will damage that leg even more.\u201d \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill all three of us!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019ll be only one murder here tonight,\u201d said Black, and his grin widened. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron and Hermione. \u201cDidn\u2019t care last time, did you? Didn\u2019t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew. \u2026 What\u2019s the matter, gone soft in Azkaban?\u201d \u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione whimpered. \u201cBe quiet!\u201d \u201cHE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\u201d Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione\u2019s and Ron\u2019s restraint and lunged forward \u2014He",
        "had forgotten about magic \u2014 he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man \u2014 all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn\u2019t care how much he got hurt in return \u2014 Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn\u2019t raise the wands in time \u2014 one of Harry\u2019s hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry\u2019s other hand collided with the side of Black\u2019s head and they fell, backward, into the wall \u2014 Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black\u2019s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry\u2019s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he",
        "clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find. But Black\u2019s free hand had found Harry\u2019s throat \u2014 \u201cNo,\u201d he hissed, \u201cI\u2019ve waited too long \u2014\u201d The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew. Then he saw Hermione\u2019s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black\u2019s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter \u2014 He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but \u2014 \u201cArgh!\u201d Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry\u2019s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry\u2019s wand \u2014 \u201cNO YOU DON\u2019T!\u201d roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand",
        "and turned \u2014 \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d he shouted at Ron and Hermione. They didn\u2019t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up herand Ron\u2019s wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg. Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black\u2019s heart. \u201cGoing to kill me, Harry?\u201d he whispered. Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black\u2019s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black\u2019s left eye and his nose was bleeding. \u201cYou killed my parents,\u201d said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady. Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes. \u201cI",
        "don\u2019t deny it,\u201d he said very quietly. \u201cBut if you knew the whole story.\u201d \u201cThe whole story?\u201d Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \u201cYou sold them to Voldemort. That\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to listen to me,\u201d Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. \u2026 You don\u2019t understand. \u2026\u201d \u201cI understand a lot better than you think,\u201d said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. \u201cYou never heard her, did you? My mum \u2026 trying to stop Voldemort killing me \u2026 and you did that \u2026 you did it. \u2026\u201d Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black\u2019s chest and settled himself there, right over Black\u2019s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat. \u201cGet off,\u201d he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks",
        "off him. But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black\u2019s robes and wouldn\u2019t shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob. Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the wand. So what if he had to kill the cattoo? It was in league with Black. \u2026 If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn\u2019t Harry\u2019s business. \u2026 If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry\u2019s parents. \u2026 Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance. \u2026 The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,",
        "Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron\u2019s ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent. And then came a new sound \u2014 Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor \u2014 someone was moving downstairs. \u201cWE\u2019RE UP HERE!\u201d Hermione screamed suddenly. \u201cWE\u2019RE UP HERE \u2014 SIRIUS BLACK \u2014 QUICK!\u201d Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand convulsively \u2014 Do it now! said a voice in his head \u2014 but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn\u2019t done it. The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand",
        "covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry\u2019s feet. \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d Lupin shouted. Harry\u2019s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across his chest. Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn\u2019t done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors. Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\u201cWhere is he, Sirius?\u201d Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn\u2019t understand what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again. Black\u2019s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn\u2019t move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered. \u201cBut",
        "then \u2026 ,\u201d Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \u201c\u2026 why hasn\u2019t he shown himself before now? Unless\u201d \u2014 Lupin\u2019s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, \u201c\u2014 unless he was the one \u2026 unless you switched \u2026 without telling me?\u201d Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin\u2019s face, Black nodded. \u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry interrupted loudly, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on \u2014 ?\u201d But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixedly at Black. The Professor walked to Black\u2019s side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. \u201cI DON\u2019T BELIEVE",
        "IT!\u201d Hermione screamed. Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. \u201cYou \u2014 you \u2014\u201d \u201cHermione \u2014\u201d \u201c \u2014 you and him!\u201d \u201cHermione, calm down \u2014\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Hermione shrieked. \u201cI\u2019ve been covering up for you \u2014\u201d\u201cHermione, listen to me, please!\u201d Lupin shouted. \u201cI can explain \u2014\u201d Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury. \u201cI trusted you,\u201d he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering out of control, \u201cand all the time you\u2019ve been his friend!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI haven\u2019t been Sirius\u2019s friend, but I am now \u2014 Let me explain. \u2026\u201d \u201cNO!\u201d Hermione screamed. \u201cHarry, don\u2019t trust him, he\u2019s been helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too \u2014 he\u2019s a werewolf!\u201d There was a ringing silence. Everyone\u2019s eyes were now",
        "on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale. \u201cNot at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly one out of three, I\u2019m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don\u2019t want Harry dead. \u2026\u201d An odd shiver passed over his face. \u201cBut I won\u2019t deny that I am a werewolf.\u201d Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \u201cGet away from me, werewolf!\u201d Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d \u201cAges,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cSince I did Professor Snape\u2019s essay. \u2026\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d said Lupin coolly. \u201cHe assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant. \u2026 Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I",
        "was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d Hermione said quietly. Lupin forced a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re the cleverest witch of your age I\u2019ve ever met, Hermione.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cIf I\u2019d been a bit cleverer, I\u2019d have told everyone what you are!\u201d\u201cBut they already know,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAt least, the staff do.\u201d \u201cDumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf?\u201d Ron gasped. \u201cIs he mad?\u201d \u201cSome of the staff thought so,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cHe had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I\u2019m trustworthy \u2014\u201d \u201cAND HE WAS WRONG!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cYOU\u2019VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!\u201d He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his",
        "lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of them, dragging his leg. \u201cI have not been helping Sirius,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me a chance, I\u2019ll explain. Look \u2014\u201d He separated Harry\u2019s, Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned. \u201cThere,\u201d said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt. \u201cYou\u2019re armed, we\u2019re not. Now will you listen?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t know what to think. Was it a trick? \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been helping him,\u201d he said, with a furious glance at Black, \u201chow did you know he was here?\u201d \u201cThe map,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThe Marauder\u2019s Map. I was in my office examining it \u2014\u201d \u201cYou know how to work it?\u201d Harry said suspiciously. \u201cOf course I know how to work it,\u201d said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. \u201cI helped write it. I\u2019m Moony \u2014 that was my friends\u2019 nickname for me",
        "at school.\u201d \u201cYou wrote \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cThe important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.\u201cYou might have been wearing your father\u2019s old cloak, Harry \u2014\u201d \u201cHow d\u2019you know about the cloak?\u201d \u201cThe number of times I saw James disappearing under it\u2026 ,\u201d said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. \u201cThe point is, even if you\u2019re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder\u2019s Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid\u2019s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by somebody",
        "else.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, we weren\u2019t!\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry\u2019s interruption. \u201cI thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?\u201d \u201cNo one was with us!\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black. \u2026 I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow \u2014\u201d \u201cOne of us!\u201d Ron said angrily. \u201cNo, Ron,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cTwo of you.\u201d He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron. \u201cDo you think I could have a look at the rat?\u201d he said evenly. \u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat\u2019s Scabbers got to do with it?\u201d \u201cEverything,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cCould I see him, please?\u201d Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to",
        "stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black\u2019s leg and made a soft hissing noise. Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers. \u201cWhat?\u201d Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \u201cWhat\u2019s my rat got to do with anything?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not a rat,\u201d croaked Sirius Black suddenly. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean \u2014 of course he\u2019s a rat \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d said Lupin quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s a wizard.\u201d\u201cAn Animagus,\u201d said Black, \u201cby the name of Peter Pettigrew.\u201d"

    "Chapter 18": [
        "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. \u201cYou\u2019re both mental.\u201d \u201cRidiculous!\u201d said Hermione faintly. \u201cPeter Pettigrew\u2019s dead!\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe killed him twelve years ago!\u201d He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively. \u201cI meant to,\u201d he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \u201cbut little Peter got the better of me \u2026 not this time, though!\u201d And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black\u2019s weight fell on his broken leg. \u201cSirius, NO!\u201d Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \u201cWAIT! You can\u2019t do it just like that \u2014 they need to understand \u2014 we\u2019ve got to explain \u2014\u201d \u201cWe can explain afterwards!\u201d snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as",
        "it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron\u2019s face and neck as he tried to escape. \u201cThey\u2019ve \u2014 got \u2014 a \u2014 right \u2014 to \u2014 know \u2014 everything!\u201d Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \u201cRon\u2019s kept himas a pet! There are parts of it even I don\u2019t understand! And Harry \u2014 you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\u201d Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron\u2019s bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. \u201cTell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for. \u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re nutters, both of you,\u201d said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this. I\u2019m off.\u201d He tried to heave himself up on",
        "his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear me out, Ron,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cJust keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\u201d \u201cHE\u2019S NOT PETER, HE\u2019S SCABBERS!\u201d Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin. \u201cThere were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\u201d he said. \u201cA whole street full of them \u2026\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t see what they thought they saw!\u201d said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron\u2019s hands. \u201cEveryone thought Sirius killed Peter,\u201d said Lupin, nodding. \u201cI believed it myself \u2014 until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder\u2019s map never lies \u2026 Peter\u2019s alive. Ron\u2019s holding him, Harry.\u201d Harry looked down at Ron,",
        "and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all \u2014 but why was Lupin playing along with him? Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.\u201cBut Professor Lupin \u2026 Scabbers can\u2019t be Pettigrew \u2026 it just can\u2019t be true, you know it can\u2019t \u2026\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be true?\u201d Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows. \u201cBecause \u2026 because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework \u2014 the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches",
        "and wizards who can become animals; there\u2019s a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things \u2026 and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the list \u2014\u201d Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh. \u201cRight again, Hermione!\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\u201d snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers\u2019s every desperate move. \u201cI\u2019ve waited twelve years, I\u2019m not going to wait much longer.\u201d \u201cAll right \u2026 but you\u2019ll need to help me, Sirius,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cI only know how it began \u2026\u201d Lupin broke off. There had been a",
        "loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing. \u201cNo one there \u2026\u201d \u201cThis place is haunted!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \u201cThe Shrieking Shack was never haunted. \u2026 The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\u201dHe pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s where all of this starts \u2014 with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn\u2019t been bitten \u2026 and if I hadn\u2019t been so foolhardy. \u2026\u201d He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \u201cShh!\u201d She was watching Lupin very intently. \u201cI was a very small boy when I received the bite.",
        "My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. \u2026 I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. \u201cBefore the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren\u2019t likely to want their children exposed to me. \u201cBut then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn\u2019t come to school. \u2026\u201d Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \u201cI",
        "told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\u201d \u2014 Lupin looked miserably around the room, \u2014 \u201cthe tunnel that leads to it \u2014 they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin\u2019s voice was Scabbers\u2019s frightened squeaking. \u201cMy transformations in those days were \u2014 were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separatedfrom humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming",
        "and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. \u2026 Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don\u2019t dare approach it. \u2026 \u201cBut apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black \u2026 Peter Pettigrew \u2026 and, of course, your father, Harry \u2014 James Potter. \u201cNow, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her. \u2026 I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. \u2026 \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t desert me at all. Instead, they did something",
        "for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\u201d \u201cMy dad too?\u201d said Harry, astounded. \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIt took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong \u2014 one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\u201d \u201cBut how did that help you?\u201d said Hermione, sounding puzzled. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cA werewolf is only a danger to people. They",
        "sneaked out of the castle every month under James\u2019s Invisibility Cloak. They transformed \u2026 Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow\u2019sattacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\u201d \u201cHurry up, Remus,\u201d snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face. \u201cI\u2019m getting there, Sirius, I\u2019m getting there \u2026 well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out",
        "more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. \u2026 And that\u2019s how we came to write the Marauder\u2019s Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of animal \u2014 ?\u201d Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. \u201cThat was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you\u2019d given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\u201d \u201cA thought that still haunts me,\u201d said Lupin heavily. \u201cAnd there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless \u2014 carried away with our own cleverness.\u201d \u201cI sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore\u2019s trust, of course \u2026 he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others\u2019",
        "safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month\u2019s adventure. And I haven\u2019t changed \u2026\u201dLupin\u2019s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \u201cAll this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn\u2019t do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I\u2019d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I\u2019d led others along with me \u2026 and Dumbledore\u2019s trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself",
        "that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it \u2026 so, in a way, Snape\u2019s been right about me all along.\u201d \u201cSnape?\u201d said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \u201cWhat\u2019s Snape got to do with it?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s here, Sirius,\u201d said Lupin heavily. \u201cHe\u2019s teaching here as well.\u201d He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cProfessor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons \u2026 you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me \u2014\u201d Black made a derisive noise. \u201cIt served him",
        "right,\u201d he sneered. \u201cSneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to \u2026 hoping he could get us expelled. \u2026\u201d \u201cSeverus was very interested in where I went every month.\u201d Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cWe were in the same year, you know, and we \u2014 er \u2014 didn\u2019t like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James\u2019s talent on the Quidditch field \u2026 anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be \u2014 er \u2014amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he\u2019d be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it \u2014 if he\u2019d got as far as this house, he\u2019d have met",
        "a fully grown werewolf \u2014 but your father, who\u2019d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life \u2026 Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. \u2026\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s why Snape doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cbecause he thought you were in on the joke?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin."

        "The Servant of Lord Voldemort Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he\u2019d received a huge electric shock. \u201cI found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\u201d said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin\u2019s chest. \u201cVery useful, Potter, I thank you. \u2026\u201d Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\u201d he said, his eyes glittering. \u201cI\u2019ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did \u2026 lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\u201d \u201cSeverus \u2014\u201d Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve told the headmaster again and again that you\u2019re helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here\u2019s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout \u2014\u201d \u201cSeverus, you\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d said Lupin urgently. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard everything \u2014 I can explain \u2014 Sirius is not here to kill Harry \u2014\u201d \u201cTwo more for Azkaban tonight,\u201d said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \u201cI shall be interested to see howDumbledore takes this. \u2026 He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin \u2026 a tame werewolf \u2014\u201d \u201cYou fool,\u201d said Lupin softly. \u201cIs a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\u201d BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape\u2019s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin\u2019s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With",
        "a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black\u2019s eyes. \u201cGive me a reason,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGive me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\u201d Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred. Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \u201cProfessor Snape \u2014 it \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t hurt to hear what they\u2019ve got to say, w \u2014 would it?\u201d \u201cMiss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\u201d Snape spat. \u201cYou, Potter, and Weasley are out- of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf.",
        "For once in your life, hold your tongue.\u201d \u201cBut if \u2014 if there was a mistake \u2014\u201d \u201cKEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\u201d Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \u201cDON\u2019T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND!\u201d A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black\u2019s face. Hermione fell silent. \u201cVengeance is very sweet,\u201d Snape breathed at Black. \u201cHow I hoped I would be the one to catch you. \u2026\u201d \u201cThe joke\u2019s on you again, Severus,\u201d Black snarled. \u201cAs long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\u201d \u2014 he jerked his head at Ron \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll come quietly. \u2026\u201d\u201cUp to the castle?\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They\u2019ll be very pleased to see you, Black \u2026 pleased enough",
        "to give you a little kiss, I daresay. \u2026\u201d What little color there was in Black\u2019s face left it. \u201cYou \u2014 you\u2019ve got to hear me out,\u201d he croaked. \u201cThe rat \u2014 look at the rat \u2014\u201d But there was a mad glint in Snape\u2019s eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason. \u201cCome on, all of you,\u201d he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too \u2014\u201d Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door. \u201cGet out of the way, Potter, you\u2019re in enough trouble already,\u201d snarled Snape. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been here to save your skin \u2014\u201d \u201cProfessor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\u201d Harry",
        "said. \u201cI\u2019ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn\u2019t he just finish me off then?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf\u2019s mind works,\u201d hissed Snape. \u201cGet out of the way, Potter.\u201d \u201cYOU\u2019RE PATHETIC!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cJUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON\u2019T EVEN LISTEN \u2014\u201d \u201cSILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\u201d Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \u201cLike father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he\u2019d killed you! You\u2019d have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black \u2014 now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\u201dHarry made up his mind in a",
        "split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand. \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d he yelled \u2014 except that his wasn\u2019t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out. Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape\u2019s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d said Black, looking at Harry. \u201cYou should have left him to me. \u2026\u201d Harry avoided Black\u2019s eyes. He wasn\u2019t sure, even now, that he\u2019d done the right thing. \u201cWe attacked a teacher. \u2026 We attacked a teacher \u2026 ,\u201d Hermione",
        "whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to be in so much trouble \u2014\u201d Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them. \u201cThank you, Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still not saying I believe you,\u201d he told Lupin. \u201cThen it\u2019s time we offered you some proof,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cYou, boy \u2014 give me Peter, please. Now.\u201d Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest. \u201cCome off it,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cAre you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean \u2026\u201d He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \u201cOkay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat \u2014 there are millions of rats \u2014 how\u2019s he supposed to know which one he\u2019s after if he was locked up in",
        "Azkaban?\u201d \u201cYou know, Sirius, that\u2019s a fair question,\u201d said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \u201cHow did you findout where he was?\u201d Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others. It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron\u2019s shoulder, was Scabbers. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck. \u201cFudge,\u201d said Black. \u201cWhen he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page \u2026 on this boy\u2019s shoulder. \u2026 I knew him at once \u2026 how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts \u2026 to where Harry was. \u2026\u201d \u201cMy",
        "God,\u201d said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \u201cHis front paw \u2026\u201d \u201cWhat about it?\u201d said Ron defiantly. \u201cHe\u2019s got a toe missing,\u201d said Black. \u201cOf course,\u201d Lupin breathed. \u201cSo simple \u2026 so brilliant \u2026 he cut it off himself?\u201d \u201cJust before he transformed,\u201d said Black. \u201cWhen I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I\u2019d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself \u2014 and sped down into the sewer with the other rats. \u2026\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever hear, Ron?\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThe biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.\u201d \u201cLook, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He\u2019s been in my family for ages, right \u2014\u201d \u201cTwelve years, in fact,\u201d said",
        "Lupin. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever wonder why he was living so long?\u201d \u201cWe \u2014 we\u2019ve been taking good care of him!\u201d said Ron. \u201cNot looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI\u2019d guess he\u2019s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. \u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been scared of that mad cat!\u201d said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed. But that wasn\u2019t right, Harry thought suddenly. \u2026 Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks \u2026 ever since Ron\u2019s return from Egypt \u2026 since the time when Black had escaped. \u2026 \u201cThis cat isn\u2019t mad,\u201d said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks\u2019s fluffy head. \u201cHe\u2019s the most intelligent of his kind I\u2019ve ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog.",
        "It was a while before he trusted me. \u2026 Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he\u2019s been helping me. \u2026\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d breathed Hermione. \u201cHe tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn\u2019t \u2026 so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. \u2026 As I understand it, he took them from a boy\u2019s bedside table. \u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd \u2026 and yet \u2026 \u201cBut Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it. \u2026\u201d croaked Black. \u201cThis cat \u2014 Crookshanks, did you call him? \u2014 told me Peter had left blood on the sheets. \u2026 I supposed he bit himself. \u2026 Well, faking his own death had worked once. \u2026\u201d These words jolted Harry to his senses. \u201cAnd why did he fake his",
        "death?\u201d he said furiously. \u201cBecause he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cHarry \u2014\u201d \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve come to finish him off!\u201d \u201cYes, I have,\u201d said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers. \u201cThen I should\u2019ve let Snape take you!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cHarry,\u201d said Lupin hurriedly, \u201cdon\u2019t you see? All this time we\u2019ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down \u2014 but it was the other way around, don\u2019t you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father \u2014 Sirius tracked Peter down \u2014\u201d\u201cTHAT\u2019S NOT TRUE!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cHE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\u201d He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly overbright. \u201cHarry \u2026 I as good as killed them,\u201d he croaked. \u201cI persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter",
        "at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me. \u2026 I\u2019m to blame, I know it. \u2026 The night they died, I\u2019d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he\u2019d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn\u2019t feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents\u2019 house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies \u2026 I realized what Peter must\u2019ve done \u2026 what I\u2019d done. \u2026\u201d His voice broke. He turned away. \u201cEnough of this,\u201d said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before. \u201cThere\u2019s one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\u201d Ron asked Lupin",
        "tensely. \u201cForce him to show himself,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIf he really is a rat, it won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \u201cReady, Sirius?\u201d said Lupin. Black had already retrieved Snape\u2019s wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face. \u201cTogether?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI think so,\u201d said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. \u201cOn the count of three. One \u2014 two \u2014 THREE!\u201dA flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly \u2014 Ron yelled \u2014 the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash",
        "of light and then \u2014 It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up. He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers\u2019s fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and",
        "back again. \u201cWell, hello, Peter,\u201d said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him. \u201cLong time, no see.\u201d \u201cS \u2014 Sirius \u2026 R \u2014 Remus \u2026\u201d Even Pettigrew\u2019s voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door. \u201cMy friends \u2026 my old friends \u2026\u201d Black\u2019s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed \u2014\u201d \u201cRemus,\u201d gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, \u201cyou don\u2019t believe him, do you\u2026 ? He tried to kill me, Remus. \u2026\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Lupin, more coldly. \u201cI\u2019d like to",
        "clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you\u2019d beso \u2014\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s come to try and kill me again!\u201d Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. \u201cHe killed Lily and James and now he\u2019s going to kill me too. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to help me, Remus. \u2026\u201d Black\u2019s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to try and kill you until we\u2019ve sorted a few things out,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cSorted things out?\u201d squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. \u201cI knew he\u2019d come after me! I knew he\u2019d be back for me! I\u2019ve been waiting for this for twelve years!\u201d \u201cYou knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\u201d said",
        "Lupin, his brow furrowed. \u201cWhen nobody has ever done it before?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\u201d Pettigrew shouted shrilly. \u201cHow else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\u201d Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room. \u201cVoldemort, teach me tricks?\u201d he said. Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him. \u201cWhat, scared to hear your old master\u2019s name?\u201d said Black. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, Peter. His lot aren\u2019t very happy with you, are they?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know what you mean, Sirius \u2014\u201d muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been hiding from me for twelve years,\u201d said Black. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hiding from Voldemort\u2019s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. \u2026 They all think you\u2019re dead, or you\u2019d",
        "have to answer to them. \u2026 I\u2019ve heard themscreaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters\u2019 on your information \u2026 and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort\u2019s supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they\u2019ve seen the error of their ways. \u2026 If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter \u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know \u2026 what you\u2019re talking about\u2026 ,\u201d said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe this \u2014 this madness, Remus \u2014\u201d \u201cI must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\u201d said Lupin evenly. \u201cInnocent, but scared!\u201d squealed Pettigrew. \u201cIf Voldemort\u2019s supporters were",
        "after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban \u2014 the spy, Sirius Black!\u201d Black\u2019s face contorted. \u201cHow dare you,\u201d he growled, sounding suddenly like the bear-sized dog he had been. \u201cI, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter \u2014 I\u2019ll never understand why I didn\u2019t see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who\u2019d look after you, didn\u2019t you? It used to be us \u2026 me and Remus \u2026 and James. \u2026\u201d Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath. \u201cMe, a spy \u2026 must be out of your mind \u2026 never \u2026 don\u2019t know how you can say such a \u2014\u201d \u201cLily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,\u201d Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a",
        "step backward. \u201cI thought it was the perfect plan \u2026 a bluff. \u2026 Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they\u2019d use a weak, talentless thing like you. \u2026It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\u201d Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like \u201cfar-fetched\u201d and \u201clunacy,\u201d but he couldn\u2019t help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew\u2019s face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door. \u201cProfessor Lupin?\u201d said Hermione timidly. \u201cCan \u2014 can I say something?\u201d \u201cCertainly, Hermione,\u201d said Lupin courteously. \u201cWell \u2014 Scabbers \u2014 I mean, this \u2014 this man \u2014 he\u2019s been sleeping in Harry\u2019s dormitory for three years. If he\u2019s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed",
        "hand. \u201cThank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry\u2019s head! Why should I?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d said Black. \u201cBecause you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort\u2019s been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he\u2019s half dead. You weren\u2019t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore\u2019s nose, for a wreck of a wizard who\u2019d lost all of his power, were you? You\u2019d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn\u2019t you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren\u2019t you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him. \u2026\u201d Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have",
        "lost the ability to talk. \u201cEr \u2014 Mr. Black \u2014 Sirius?\u201d said Hermione. Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how \u2014 how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn\u2019t use Dark Magic?\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \u201cExactly! Precisely what I \u2014\u201d But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn\u2019t a happy thought, so the dementors couldn\u2019t suck it out of me \u2026 but it kept me sane and knowing who I am \u2026 helped",
        "me keep my powers \u2026 so when it all became \u2026 too much \u2026 I could transform in my cell \u2026 become a dog. Dementors can\u2019t see, you know. \u2026\u201d He swallowed. \u201cThey feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions. \u2026 They could tell that my feelings were less \u2014 less human, less complex when I was a dog \u2026 but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn\u2019t trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand. \u2026 \u201cBut then I saw Peter in that picture \u2026 I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry \u2026 perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again. \u2026\u201d Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but",
        "staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized. \u201c\u2026 ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies \u2026 and to deliver the last Potter to them. If he gave them Harry, who\u2019d dare say he\u2019d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He\u2019d be welcomed back with honors. \u2026 \u201cSo you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive. \u2026\u201d Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley. \u201cThe guards say he\u2019s been talking in his sleep \u2026 always the same words \u2026 \u2018He\u2019s at Hogwarts.\u2019 \u201d \u201cIt was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the dementors couldn\u2019t destroy it. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t a happy feeling \u2026 it was an obsession \u2026 but it gave me strength, it clearedmy mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past",
        "them as a dog. \u2026 It\u2019s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused. \u2026 I was thin, very thin \u2026 thin enough to slip through the bars. \u2026 I swam as a dog back to the mainland. \u2026 I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I\u2019ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. \u2026\u201d He looked at Harry, who did not look away. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d croaked Black. \u201cBelieve me, Harry. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\u201d And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded. \u201cNo!\u201d Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry\u2019s nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his",
        "knees, groveling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying. \u201cSirius \u2014 it\u2019s me \u2026 it\u2019s Peter \u2026 your friend \u2026 you wouldn\u2019t \u2026\u201d Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled. \u201cThere\u2019s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\u201d said Black. \u201cRemus!\u201d Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe this \u2026 wouldn\u2019t Sirius have told you they\u2019d changed the plan?\u201d \u201cNot if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI assume that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t tell me, Sirius?\u201d he said casually over Pettigrew\u2019s head. \u201cForgive me, Remus,\u201d said Black. \u201cNot at all, Padfoot, old friend,\u201d said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. \u201cAnd will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up",
        "his sleeves.\u201cShall we kill him together?\u201d \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d said Lupin grimly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t \u2026 you won\u2019t\u2026 ,\u201d gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled around to Ron. \u201cRon \u2026 haven\u2019t I been a good friend \u2026 a good pet? You won\u2019t let them kill me, Ron, will you \u2026 you\u2019re on my side, aren\u2019t you?\u201d But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion. \u201cI let you sleep in my bed!\u201d he said. \u201cKind boy \u2026 kind master \u2026\u201d Pettigrew crawled toward Ron, \u201cyou won\u2019t let them do it. \u2026 I was your rat. \u2026 I was a good pet. \u2026\u201d \u201cIf you made a better rat than a human, it\u2019s not much to boast about, Peter,\u201d said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew\u2019s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione\u2019s robes. \u201cSweet",
        "girl \u2026 clever girl \u2026 you \u2014 you won\u2019t let them. \u2026 Help me. \u2026\u201d Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew\u2019s clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified. Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned his head slowly toward Harry. \u201cHarry \u2026 Harry \u2026 you look just like your father \u2026 just like him. \u2026\u201d \u201cHOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\u201d roared Black. \u201cHOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\u201d \u201cHarry,\u201d whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. \u201cHarry, James wouldn\u2019t have wanted me killed. \u2026 James would have understood, Harry \u2026 he would have shown me mercy. \u2026\u201d Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew\u2019s shoulders, and threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them.\u201cYou sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\u201d said Black, who was shaking too. \u201cDo you",
        "deny it?\u201d Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor. \u201cSirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord \u2026 you have no idea \u2026 he has weapons you can\u2019t imagine. \u2026 I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen. \u2026 He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named forced me \u2014\u201d \u201cDON\u2019T LIE!\u201d bellowed Black. \u201cYOU\u2019D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\u201d \u201cHe \u2014 he was taking over everywhere!\u201d gasped Pettigrew. \u201cWh \u2014 what was there to be gained by refusing him?\u201d \u201cWhat was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?\u201d said Black, with a terribly fury in his face. \u201cOnly innocent lives, Peter!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d whined Pettigrew. \u201cHe would have killed me,",
        "Sirius!\u201d \u201cTHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\u201d roared Black. \u201cDIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\u201d Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised. \u201cYou should have realized,\u201d said Lupin quietly, \u201cif Voldemort didn\u2019t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.\u201d Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall. \u201cNO!\u201d Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front of Pettigrew, facing the wands. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Black and Lupin both looked staggered. \u201cHarry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\u201d Black snarled. \u201cThis cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him up to the castle. We\u2019ll hand him over to the dementors. \u2026",
        "He can go to Azkaban \u2026 but don\u2019t kill him.\u201d \u201cHarry!\u201d gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry\u2019s knees. \u201cYou \u2014 thank you \u2014 it\u2019s more than I deserve \u2014 thank you \u2014\u201d \u201cGet off me,\u201d Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew\u2019s hands off him in disgust. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for you. I\u2019m doing it because \u2014 I don\u2019t reckon my dad would\u2019ve wanted them to become killers \u2014 just for you.\u201d No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\u201d said Black. \u201cBut think \u2026 think what he did. \u2026\u201d \u201cHe can go to Azkaban,\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cIf anyone deserves that place, he does. \u2026\u201d Pettigrew was still wheezing behind",
        "him. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cStand aside, Harry.\u201d Harry hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m going to tie him up,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThat\u2019s all, I swear.\u201d Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin\u2019s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged. \u201cBut if you transform, Peter,\u201d growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, \u201cwe will kill you. You agree, Harry?\u201d Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him. \u201cRight,\u201d said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \u201cRon, I can\u2019t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it\u2019s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\u201d He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron\u2019s leg with his wand, and muttered, \u201cFerula.\u201d Bandages spun up Ron\u2019s leg, strapping it tightly to a",
        "splint. Lupin helped him to hisfeet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn\u2019t wince. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d \u201cWhat about Professor Snape?\u201d said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape\u2019s prone figure. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing seriously wrong with him,\u201d said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. \u201cYou were just a little \u2014 overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er \u2014 perhaps it will be best if we don\u2019t revive him until we\u2019re safely back in the castle. We can take him like this. \u2026\u201d He muttered, \u201cMobilicorpus.\u201d As though invisible strings were tied to Snape\u2019s wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket. \u201cAnd two of us should be",
        "chained to this,\u201d said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. \u201cJust to make sure.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAnd me,\u201d said Ron savagely, limping forward. Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Lupin\u2019s right, right arm to Ron\u2019s left. Ron\u2019s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers\u2019s true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high."

    "Chapter 20": [
        "The Dementor\u2019s Kiss Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione brought up the rear. Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this. \u201cYou",
        "know what this means?\u201d Black said abruptly to Harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel. \u201cTurning Pettigrew in?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re free,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYes \u2026 ,\u201d said Black. \u201cBut I\u2019m also \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone ever told you \u2014 I\u2019m your godfather.\u201d \u201cYeah, I knew that,\u201d said Harry.\u201cWell \u2026 your parents appointed me your guardian,\u201d said Black stiffly. \u201cIf anything happened to them \u2026\u201d Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant? \u201cI\u2019ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,\u201d said Black. \u201cBut \u2026 well \u2026 think about it. Once my name\u2019s cleared \u2026 if you wanted a \u2026 a different home \u2026\u201d Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry\u2019s stomach. \u201cWhat \u2014 live with you?\u201d he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. \u201cLeave the Dursleys?\u201d",
        "\u201cOf course, I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to,\u201d said Black quickly. \u201cI understand, I just thought I\u2019d \u2014\u201d \u201cAre you insane?\u201d said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black\u2019s. \u201cOf course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?\u201d Black turned right around to look at him; Snape\u2019s head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cYou want to?\u201d he said. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d \u201cYeah, I mean it!\u201d said Harry. Black\u2019s gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry\u2019s parents\u2019 wedding. They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he",
        "had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches. Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out. The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry\u2019s mind was buzzing. He was going toleave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his parents\u2019 best friend. \u2026 He felt dazed. \u2026 What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they\u2019d seen on television\u2026 ! \u201cOne wrong move, Peter,\u201d said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew\u2019s chest. Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle",
        "lights growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chin bumping on his chest. And then \u2014 A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight. Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop. Harry could see Lupin\u2019s silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs began to shake. \u201cOh, my \u2014\u201d Hermione gasped. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take his potion tonight! He\u2019s not safe!\u201d \u201cRun,\u201d Black whispered. \u201cRun. Now.\u201d But Harry couldn\u2019t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back. \u201cLeave it to me \u2014 RUN!\u201d There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin\u2019s head was lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on",
        "his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks\u2019s hair was on end again; he was backing away \u2014 As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from Harry\u2019s side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other \u2014 Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione\u2019s screamthat alerted him \u2014 Pettigrew had dived for Lupin\u2019s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light \u2014 and Ron lay motionless on the ground. Another bang \u2014 Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap.",
        "\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin\u2019s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. \u201cStay where you are!\u201d Harry shouted, running forward. Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron\u2019s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass. There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest \u2014 \u201cSirius, he\u2019s gone, Pettigrew transformed!\u201d Harry yelled. Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry\u2019s words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds. Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron. \u201cWhat did he do to him?\u201d Hermione whispered. Ron\u2019s eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they",
        "could hear him breathing, but he didn\u2019t seem to recognize them. \u201cI don\u2019t know. \u2026\u201d Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone \u2026 they had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair. \u201cWe\u2019d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,\u201d said Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. Come \u2014\u201d But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. \u2026 \u201cSirius,\u201d Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.He had a moment\u2019s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble \u2014 Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and Harry, running",
        "flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it must mean \u2014 The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw why \u2014 Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands over his head. \u201cNooo,\u201d he moaned. \u201cNoooo \u2026 please. \u2026\u201d And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them. \u2026 \u201cHermione, think of something happy!\u201d Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it \u2014 I\u2019m going to live with my godfather. I\u2019m leaving the Dursleys. He forced",
        "himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: \u201cExpecto patronum! Expecto patronum!\u201d Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death. He\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m going to go and live with him. \u201cExpecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!\u201d \u201cExpecto \u2014\u201d Hermione whispered, \u201cexpecto \u2014 expecto \u2014\u201d But she couldn\u2019t do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer. \u2026 \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his ears. \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201dA thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him. At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was alone \u2026 completely alone. \u2026 \u201cExpecto \u2014 expecto patronum \u2014\u201d Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes.",
        "With a huge effort, he fought to remember \u2014 Sirius was innocent \u2014 innocent \u2014 We\u2019ll be okay \u2014 I\u2019m going to live with him \u2014 \u201cExpecto patronum!\u201d he gasped. By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a dementor halt, very close to him. It couldn\u2019t walk through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside. \u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014\u201d Harry gasped. \u201cHe\u2019s innocent \u2026 expecto \u2014 expecto patronum \u2014\u201d He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it raised both its rotting hands \u2014 and lowered its hood. Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there",
        "was a mouth \u2026 a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn\u2019t move or speak. His Patronus flickered and died. White fog was blinding him. He had to fight \u2026 expecto patronum \u2026 he couldn\u2019t see \u2026 and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming \u2026 expecto patronum \u2026 he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm \u2026 they weren\u2019t going to take him. \u2026 But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry\u2019s neck. They were forcing his face upward. \u2026 He could feel its breath. \u2026 It was going to get rid of him first. \u2026 He could feel its putrid breath. \u2026 His mother was screaming in his ears. \u2026 She was going to be the last thing he ever heard \u2014And then, through the",
        "fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter. \u2026 He felt himself fall forward onto the grass. \u2026 Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him. \u2026 The screaming had stopped, the cold was ebbing away. \u2026 Something was driving the dementors back. \u2026 It was circling around him and Black and Hermione. \u2026 They were leaving. \u2026 The air was warm again. \u2026 With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake. \u2026 Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it was. \u2026 It was as bright as a unicorn. \u2026 Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a",
        "halt as it reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back \u2026 raising his hand to pat it \u2026 someone who looked strangely familiar \u2026 but it couldn\u2019t be \u2026 Harry didn\u2019t understand. He couldn\u2019t think anymore. He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted."

First Class, if I can wangle it!\u201d \u201cThank you very much indeed, Minister.\u201d \u201cNasty cut you\u2019ve got there. \u2026 Black\u2019s work, I suppose?\u201d \u201cAs a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister. \u2026\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cBlack had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent. They weren\u2019t responsible for their actions. On the other hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape. \u2026 They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They\u2019ve got away with a great deal before now. \u2026 I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s given them a rather high opinion",
        "of themselves \u2026 and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster \u2014\u201d \u201cAh, well, Snape \u2026 Harry Potter, you know \u2026 we\u2019ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he\u2019s concerned.\u201d\u201cAnd yet \u2014 is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student would be suspended \u2014 at the very least \u2014 for leading his friends into such danger. Consider, Minister \u2014 against all school rules \u2014 after all the precautions put in place for his protection \u2014 out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer \u2014 and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too \u2014\u201d \u201cWell, well \u2026 we shall see, Snape, we shall see. \u2026 The boy has undoubtedly been foolish. \u2026\u201d Harry lay listening",
        "with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand. \u2026 His limbs felt like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift. \u2026 He wanted to lie here, on this comfortable bed, forever. \u2026 \u201cWhat amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors \u2026 you\u2019ve really no idea what made them retreat, Snape?\u201d \u201cNo, Minister \u2026 by the time I had come \u2019round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances. \u2026\u201d \u201cExtraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl \u2014\u201d \u201cAll unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to the castle.\u201d There was a pause. Harry\u2019s brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did,",
        "a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach. \u2026 He opened his eyes. Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed. Harry squinted. Ron\u2019s red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey\u2019s arm. Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked petrified, and when shesaw that Harry was awake, pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside. Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry\u2019s bed. He turned to",
        "look at her. She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder. \u201cAh, you\u2019re awake!\u201d she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on Harry\u2019s bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer. \u201cHow\u2019s Ron?\u201d said Harry and Hermione together. \u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey grimly. \u201cAs for you two \u2026 you\u2019ll be staying here until I\u2019m satisfied you\u2019re \u2014 Potter, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his wand. \u201cI need to see the headmaster,\u201d he said. \u201cPotter,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, \u201cit\u2019s all right. They\u2019ve got Black. He\u2019s locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now \u2014\u201d \u201cWHAT?\u201d Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout had been heard in the corridor",
        "outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward. \u201cHarry, Harry, what\u2019s this?\u201d said Fudge, looking agitated. \u201cYou should be in bed \u2014 has he had any chocolate?\u201d he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously. \u201cMinister, listen!\u201d Harry said. \u201cSirius Black\u2019s innocent! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can\u2019t let the dementors do that thing to Sirius, he\u2019s \u2014\u201d But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face. \u201cHarry, Harry, you\u2019re very confused, you\u2019ve been through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we\u2019ve got everything under control. \u2026\u201d\u201cYOU HAVEN\u2019T!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cYOU\u2019VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!\u201d \u201cMinister, listen, please,\u201d Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry\u2019s side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge\u2019s face. \u201cI saw him too. It was Ron\u2019s rat, he\u2019s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and \u2014\u201d \u201cYou see, Minister?\u201d said Snape. \u201cConfunded, both of them. \u2026",
        "Black\u2019s done a very good job on them. \u2026\u201d \u201cWE\u2019RE NOT CONFUNDED!\u201d Harry roared. \u201cMinister! Professor!\u201d said Madam Pomfrey angrily. \u201cI must insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not distressed, I\u2019m trying to tell them what happened!\u201d Harry said furiously. \u201cIf they\u2019d just listen \u2014\u201d But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry\u2019s mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed. \u201cNow, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave \u2014\u201d The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again. \u201cProfessor Dumbledore, Sirius Black \u2014\u201d \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. \u201cIs this a hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist \u2014\u201d \u201cMy apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger,\u201d said",
        "Dumbledore calmly. \u201cI have just been talking to Sirius Black \u2014\u201d \u201cI suppose he\u2019s told you the same fairy tale he\u2019s planted in Potter\u2019s mind?\u201d spat Snape. \u201cSomething about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive \u2014\u201d \u201cThat, indeed, is Black\u2019s story,\u201d said Dumbledore, surveying Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles. \u201cAnd does my evidence count for nothing?\u201d snarled Snape. \u201cPeter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.\u201d\u201cThat was because you were knocked out, Professor!\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t arrive in time to hear \u2014\u201d \u201cMiss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!\u201d \u201cNow, Snape,\u201d said Fudge, startled, \u201cthe young lady is disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances \u2014\u201d \u201cI would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\u201d said Dumbledore abruptly. \u201cCornelius, Severus, Poppy \u2014 please leave us.\u201d \u201cHeadmaster!\u201d sputtered Madam Pomfrey \u201cThey need treatment, they need rest \u2014\u201d",
        "\u201cThis cannot wait,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI must insist.\u201d Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat. \u201cThe dementors should have arrived by now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I\u2019ll see you upstairs.\u201d He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cYou surely don\u2019t believe a word of Black\u2019s story?\u201d Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore\u2019s face. \u201cI wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\u201d Dumbledore repeated. Snape took a step toward Dumbledore. \u201cSirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven\u2019t forgotten that he once tried to kill me?\u201d \u201cMy memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,\u201d said",
        "Dumbledore quietly. Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time. \u201cProfessor, Black\u2019s telling the truth \u2014 we saw Pettigrew \u2014\u201d\u201c\u2014 he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 he\u2019s a rat \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 Pettigrew\u2019s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn\u2019t Sirius \u2014\u201d But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations. \u201cIt is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere is not a shred of proof to support Black\u2019s story, except your word \u2014 and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw",
        "Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters\u2019 Secret- Keeper.\u201d \u201cProfessor Lupin can tell you \u2014\u201d Harry said, unable to stop himself. \u201cProfessor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little \u2014 and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends \u2014\u201d \u201cBut \u2014\u201d \u201cListen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see that Professor Snape\u2019s version of events is far more convincing than yours.\u201d \u201cHe hates Sirius,\u201d Hermione said desperately. \u201cAll because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him \u2014\u201d \u201cSirius has not acted like an innocent man.

He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no \u2026 their last hope was gone. \u201cWhat we need,\u201d said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, \u201cis more time.\u201d \u201cBut \u2014\u201d Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. \u201cOH!\u201d \u201cNow, pay attention,\u201d said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly. \u201cSirius is locked",

Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\u201d \u201cGood luck?\u201d Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. \u201cThree turns? What\u2019s he talking about?

        "from beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain. \u201cHarry, come here,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cQuick!\u201d Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it. \u201cHere \u2014\u201d She had thrown the chain around his neck too. \u201cReady?\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Harry said, completely lost.Hermione turned the hourglass over three times. The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn\u2019t hear his own voice \u2014 And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into focus again \u2014 He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors.",
        "He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck. \u201cHermione, what \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cIn here!\u201d Hermione seized Harry\u2019s arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them. \u201cWhat \u2014 how \u2014 Hermione, what happened?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back in time,\u201d Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off Harry\u2019s neck in the darkness. \u201cThree hours back \u2026\u201d Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream. \u201cBut \u2014\u201d \u201cShh! Listen! Someone\u2019s coming! I think \u2014 I think it might be us!\u201d Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door. \u201cFootsteps across the hall \u2026 yes, I think it\u2019s us going down to",
        "Hagrid\u2019s!\u201d \u201cAre you telling me,\u201d Harry whispered, \u201cthat we\u2019re here in this cupboard and we\u2019re out there too?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s us. It doesn\u2019t sound like more than three people \u2026 and we\u2019re walking slowly because we\u2019re under the Invisibility Cloak \u2014\u201d She broke off, still listening intently.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone down the front steps. \u2026\u201d Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few questions answered. \u201cWhere did you get that hourglass thing?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called a Time-Turner,\u201d Hermione whispered, \u201cand I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I\u2019ve been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one. She had to tell",
        "them that I was a model student, and that I\u2019d never, ever use it for anything except my studies. \u2026 I\u2019ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again, that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been doing several lessons at once, see? But \u2026 \u201cHarry, I don\u2019t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How\u2019s that going to help Sirius?\u201d Harry stared at her shadowy face. \u201cThere must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWhat happened? We were walking down to Hagrid\u2019s three hours ago. \u2026\u201d \u201cThis is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid\u2019s,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe just heard ourselves leaving. \u2026\u201d Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration. \u201cDumbledore just said \u2014 just said we could save more than",
        "one innocent life. \u2026\u201d And then it hit him. \u201cHermione, we\u2019re going to save Buckbeak!\u201d \u201cBut \u2014 how will that help Sirius?\u201d \u201cDumbledore said \u2014 he just told us where the window is \u2014 the window of Flitwick\u2019s office! Where they\u2019ve got Sirius locked up! We\u2019ve got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak \u2014 they can escape together!\u201dFrom what Harry could see of Hermione\u2019s face, she looked terrified. \u201cIf we manage that without being seen, it\u2019ll be a miracle!\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got to try, haven\u2019t we?\u201d said Harry. He stood up and pressed his ear against the door. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s there. \u2026 Come on, let\u2019s go. \u2026\u201d Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps. The shadows were",
        "already lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s looking out of the window \u2014\u201d Hermione squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them. \u201cWe\u2019ll run for it,\u201d said Harry determinedly. \u201cStraight into the forest, all right? We\u2019ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout \u2014\u201d \u201cOkay, but we\u2019ll go around by the greenhouses!\u201d said Hermione breathlessly. \u201cWe need to keep out of sight of Hagrid\u2019s front door, or we\u2019ll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid\u2019s by now!\u201d Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the forest. \u2026 Safe in the shadows of",
        "the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting. \u201cRight,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWe need to sneak over to Hagrid\u2019s. \u2026 Keep out of sight, Harry. \u2026\u201d They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid\u2019s house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice. \u201cIt\u2019s us. We\u2019re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\u201d \u201cYeh shouldn\u2019ve come!\u201d Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly. \u201cThis is the weirdest thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Harry said fervently. \u201cLet\u2019s move along a bit,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cWe need to get nearer to Buckbeak!\u201d",
        "They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid\u2019s pumpkin patch. \u201cNow?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIf we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We\u2019ve got to wait until they\u2019ve seen he\u2019s tied outside!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s going to give us about sixty seconds,\u201d said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible. At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid\u2019s cabin. \u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cI\u2019m going to find Scabbers in a moment \u2014\u201d Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione\u2019s shriek of surprise. \u201cHermione,\u201d said Harry suddenly, \u201cwhat if we \u2014 we just run in there and grab Pettigrew \u2014\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? We\u2019re breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody\u2019s supposed to change time, nobody!",
        "You heard Dumbledore, if we\u2019re seen \u2014\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\u201d \u201cHarry, what do you think you\u2019d do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid\u2019s house?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d think I\u2019d gone mad,\u201d said Harry, \u201cor I\u2019d think there was some Dark Magic going on \u2014\u201d\u201cExactly! You wouldn\u2019t understand, you might even attack yourself! Don\u2019t you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time. \u2026 Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!\u201d \u201cOkay!\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was just an idea, I just thought \u2014\u201d But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps. \u201cWe\u2019re about to come out!\u201d",
        "Hermione breathed. And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid\u2019s back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Beaky, it\u2019s okay \u2026 ,\u201d Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cGo on. Get goin\u2019.\u201d \u201cHagrid, we can\u2019t \u2014\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll tell them what really happened \u2014\u201d \u201cThey can\u2019t kill him \u2014\u201d \u201cGo! It\u2019s bad enough without you lot in trouble an\u2019 all!\u201d Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron. \u201cGo quick. Don\u2019 listen. \u2026\u201d There was a knock on Hagrid\u2019s front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in",
        "patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone \u2026 but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door. \u201cWhere is the beast?\u201d came the cold voice of Macnair. \u201cOut \u2014 outside,\u201d Hagrid croaked.Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair\u2019s face appeared at Hagrid\u2019s window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge. \u201cWe \u2014 er \u2014 have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I\u2019ll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you\u2019re supposed to listen too, that\u2019s procedure \u2014\u201d Macnair\u2019s face vanished from the window. It was now or never. \u201cWait here,\u201d Harry whispered to Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d As Fudge\u2019s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the",
        "pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak. \u201cIt is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown \u2014\u201d Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak\u2019s fierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence. \u201c\u2026 sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the Committee\u2019s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair \u2026\u201d \u201cCome on, Buckbeak,\u201d Harry murmured, \u201ccome on, we\u2019re going to help you. Quietly \u2026 quietly \u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here. \u2026\u201d Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get this over with,\u201d said the reedy voice of the Committee",
        "member from inside Hagrid\u2019s cabin. \u201cHagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, I \u2014 I wan\u2019 ter be with him. \u2026 I don\u2019 wan\u2019 him ter be alone \u2014\u201d Footsteps echoed from within the cabin. \u201cBuckbeak, move!\u201d Harry hissed.Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak\u2019s neck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid\u2019s back door. \u201cOne moment, please, Macnair,\u201d came Dumbledore\u2019s voice. \u201cYou need to sign too.\u201d The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster. Hermione\u2019s white face was sticking out from behind a tree. \u201cHarry, hurry!\u201d she mouthed. Harry could still hear Dumbledore\u2019s voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees. \u2026 \u201cQuick!",
        "Quick!\u201d Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn\u2019t see Hagrid\u2019s garden at all. \u201cStop!\u201d he whispered to Hermione. \u201cThey might hear us \u2014\u201d Hagrid\u2019s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently. Silence \u2026 then \u2014 \u201cWhere is it?\u201d said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \u201cWhere is the beast?\u201d \u201cIt was tied here!\u201d said the executioner furiously. \u201cI saw it! Just here!\u201d \u201cHow extraordinary,\u201d said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice. \u201cBeaky!\u201d said Hagrid huskily. There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling,",
        "and this time they could hear Hagrid\u2019s words through his sobs.\u201cGone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he\u2019s gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!\u201d Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him. \u201cSomeone untied him!\u201d the executioner was snarling. \u201cWe should search the grounds, the forest \u2014\u201d \u201cMacnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?\u201d said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. \u201cSearch the skies, if you will. \u2026 Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.\u201d \u201cO\u2019 \u2014 o\u2019 course, Professor,\u201d said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \u201cCome in, come in. \u2026\u201d Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of",
        "the door, and then silence once more. \u201cNow what?\u201d whispered Harry, looking around. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to hide in here,\u201d said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \u201cWe need to wait until they\u2019ve gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it\u2019s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius\u2019s window. He won\u2019t be there for another couple of hours. \u2026 Oh, this is going to be difficult. \u2026\u201d She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The sun was setting now. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to move,\u201d said Harry, thinking hard. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak\u2019s rope. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember. \u2026\u201d They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind",
        "a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow. \u201cThere\u2019s Ron!\u201d said Harry suddenly.A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air. \u201cGet away from him \u2014 get away \u2014 Scabbers, come here \u2014\u201d And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive. \u201cGotcha! Get off, you stinking cat \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s Sirius!\u201d said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron. \u2026 \u201cLooks even worse from here, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry, watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. \u201cOuch \u2014 look, I just got walloped by the tree \u2014 and so did you \u2014 this is weird \u2014\u201d The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out",
        "with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze. \u201cThat was Crookshanks pressing the knot,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd there we go \u2026 ,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re in.\u201d The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle. \u201cRight after we\u2019d gone down into the passage!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIf only Dumbledore had come with us \u2026\u201d \u201cMacnair and Fudge would\u2019ve come too,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cI bet you anything Fudge would\u2019ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot. \u2026\u201d They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then \u2014 \u201cHere comes Lupin!\u201d said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting",
        "down the stone steps and haring towardthe Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely. They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots. \u201cIf he\u2019d only grabbed the cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s just lying there. \u2026\u201d He turned to Hermione. \u201cIf I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape\u2019d never be able to get it and \u2014\u201d \u201cHarry, we mustn\u2019t be seen!\u201d \u201cHow can you stand this?\u201d he asked Hermione fiercely. \u201cJust standing here and watching it happen?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab the cloak!\u201d \u201cHarry, no!\u201d Hermione seized the back of Harry\u2019s robes not a moment too soon. Just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the",
        "top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands. \u201cSee?\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cSee what would have happened? We\u2019ve got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!\u201d The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly. Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow. Harry\u2019s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up. \u201cGet your filthy hands off it,\u201d Harry snarled under his breath. \u201cShh!\u201dSnape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot,",
        "and vanished from view as he put on the cloak. \u201cSo that\u2019s it,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re all down there \u2026 and now we\u2019ve just got to wait until we come back up again. \u2026\u201d She took the end of Buckbeak\u2019s rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees. \u201cHarry, there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand. \u2026 Why didn\u2019t the dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out \u2026 there were so many of them. \u2026\u201d Harry sat down too. He explained what he\u2019d seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry\u2019s, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat. Hermione\u2019s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished. \u201cBut what was it?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing it could",
        "have been, to make the dementors go,\u201d said Harry. \u201cA real Patronus. A powerful one.\u201d \u201cBut who conjured it?\u201d Harry didn\u2019t say anything. He was thinking back to the person he\u2019d seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been \u2026 but how could it have been? \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what they looked like?\u201d said Hermione eagerly. \u201cWas it one of the teachers?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a teacher.\u201d \u201cBut it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away. \u2026 If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn\u2019t it light him up? Couldn\u2019t you see \u2014 ?\u201d \u201cYeah, I saw him,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cBut \u2026 maybe I imagined it. \u2026 I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. \u2026 I passed out right afterward. \u2026\u201d \u201cWho did you think it was?\u201d\u201cI think \u2014\u201d Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was",
        "going to sound. \u201cI think it was my dad.\u201d Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity. \u201cHarry, your dad\u2019s \u2014 well \u2014 dead,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI know that,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cYou think you saw his ghost?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 no \u2026 he looked solid. \u2026\u201d \u201cBut then \u2014\u201d \u201cMaybe I was seeing things,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut \u2026 from what I could see \u2026 it looked like him. \u2026 I\u2019ve got photos of him. \u2026\u201d Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity. \u201cI know it sounds crazy,\u201d said Harry flatly. He turned to look at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn\u2019t really watching Buckbeak. He was thinking about his father and about his father\u2019s",
        "three oldest friends \u2026 Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. \u2026 Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead. \u2026 Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the lake? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly \u2026 yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he\u2019d lost consciousness. \u2026 The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting. And then, at last, after over an hour \u2026 \u201cHere we come!\u201d Hermione whispered. She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots \u2026 followed by theunconscious",
        "Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry, Hermione, and Black. They all began to walk toward the castle. Harry\u2019s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon. \u2026 \u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to stay put. We mustn\u2019t be seen. There\u2019s nothing we can do. \u2026\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again. \u2026\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cHow do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\u201d snapped Hermione. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we\u2019re not supposed to be doing anything else!\u201d \u201cAll right!\u201d The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement \u2014 \u201cThere goes Lupin,\u201d Hermione whispered.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s transforming \u2014\u201d \u201cHermione!\u201d said Harry suddenly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move!\u201d \u201cWe mustn\u2019t, I keep telling you \u2014\u201d \u201cNot to interfere! Lupin\u2019s going to run into the forest, right at us!\u201d Hermione gasped. \u201cQuick!\u201d she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \u201cQuick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors will be coming any moment \u2014\u201d \u201cBack to Hagrid\u2019s!\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s empty now \u2014 come on!\u201d They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them. \u2026 The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.\u201cShh, Fang, it\u2019s us!\u201d said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. \u201cThat was really close!\u201d she said to Harry.",
        "\u201cYeah \u2026\u201d Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid\u2019s house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap. \u201cI think I\u2019d better go outside again, you know,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cI can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on \u2014 we won\u2019t know when it\u2019s time \u2014\u201d Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try and interfere,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t see what\u2019s going on, how\u2019re we going to know when it\u2019s time to rescue Sirius?\u201d \u201cWell \u2026 okay, then \u2026 I\u2019ll wait here with Buckbeak \u2026 but Harry, be careful \u2014 there\u2019s a werewolf out there \u2014 and the dementors \u2014\u201d Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could",
        "hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. \u2026 He and Hermione would be running to him any moment. \u2026 Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest. \u2026 Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment. \u2026 For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid\u2019s door. You must not be seen. But he didn\u2019t want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing. \u2026 He had to know. \u2026 And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake. \u2026 They were moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank. \u2026 He wouldn\u2019t have to get near them. \u2026 Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his",
        "father. \u2026 If it was him \u2026 if it really was him \u2026 he had to know, had to find out. \u2026The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver \u2014 his own attempts at a Patronus \u2014 There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him \u2014 any moment now \u2014 \u201cCome on!\u201d he muttered, staring about. \u201cWhere are you? Dad, come on \u2014\u201d But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear \u2014 but no one was coming to",
        "help this time \u2014 And then it hit him \u2014 he understood. He hadn\u2019t seen his father \u2014 he had seen himself \u2014 Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand. \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d he yelled. And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors. \u2026 Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness. \u2026 They were gone. The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water. It wasn\u2019t",
        "a horse. It wasn\u2019t a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above \u2026 it was coming back to him. \u2026 It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And Harry realized \u2026 \u201cProngs,\u201d he whispered.But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished. Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him \u2014 he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cYou said you were only going to keep a lookout!\u201d \u201cI just saved all our lives \u2026 ,\u201d said Harry. \u201cGet behind here \u2014 behind this bush \u2014 I\u2019ll explain.\u201d Hermione listened to what had just",
        "happened with her mouth open yet again. \u201cDid anyone see you?\u201d \u201cYes, haven\u2019t you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It\u2019s okay!\u201d \u201cHarry, I can\u2019t believe it. \u2026 You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That\u2019s very, very advanced magic. \u2026\u201d \u201cI knew I could do it this time,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause I\u2019d already done it. \u2026 Does that make sense?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 Harry, look at Snape!\u201d Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle. \u201cRight, it\u2019s nearly time,\u201d said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got",
        "about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We\u2019ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we\u2019re missing. \u2026\u201d They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again. \u201cD\u2019 you reckon he\u2019s up there yet?\u201d said Harry, checking his watch. He looked up at the castle and began countingthe windows to the right of the West Tower. \u201cLook!\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cWho\u2019s that? Someone\u2019s coming back out of the castle!\u201d Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt. \u201cMacnair!\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe executioner! He\u2019s gone to get the dementors! This is it, Hermione \u2014\u201d Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak\u2019s back and Harry gave her a leg up.",
        "Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak\u2019s rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins. \u201cReady?\u201d he whispered to Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019d better hold on to me \u2014\u201d He nudged Buckbeak\u2019s sides with his heels. Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear her muttering, \u201cOh, no \u2014 I don\u2019t like this \u2014 oh, I really don\u2019t like this \u2014\u201d Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle. \u2026 Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past \u2014",
        "\u201cWhoa!\u201d he said, pulling backward as hard as he could. Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne. \u201cHe\u2019s there!\u201d Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak\u2019s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the glass. Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.\u201cStand back!\u201d Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry\u2019s robes with her left hand. \u201cAlohomora!\u201d The window sprang open. \u201cHow \u2014 how \u2014 ?\u201d said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff. \u201cGet on \u2014 there\u2019s not much time,\u201d said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly on",
        "either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of here \u2014 the dementors are coming \u2014 Macnair\u2019s gone to get them.\u201d Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak\u2019s back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione. \u201cOkay, Buckbeak, up!\u201d said Harry, shaking the rope. \u201cUp to the tower \u2014 come on!\u201d The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once. \u201cSirius, you\u2019d better go, quick,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cThey\u2019ll reach Flitwick\u2019s office any moment, they\u2019ll find out you\u2019re gone.\u201d Buckbeak",
        "pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head. \u201cWhat happened to the other boy? Ron?\u201d croaked Sirius. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay. He\u2019s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says she\u2019ll be able to make him better. Quick \u2014 go \u2014\u201d But Black was still staring down at Harry. \u201cHow can I ever thank \u2014\u201d \u201cGO!\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted together. Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky. \u201cWe\u2019ll see each other again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are \u2014 truly your father\u2019s son, Harry. \u2026\u201dHe squeezed Buckbeak\u2019s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more. \u2026 The hippogriff took off into the air. \u2026 He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them \u2026 then a cloud drifted across the moon. \u2026 They were gone."

        "Owl Post Again \u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us \u2014 before Dumbledore locks the door \u2014\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, \u201clet\u2019s go. \u2026\u201d They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase. \u201c\u2026 only hope Dumbledore\u2019s not going to make difficulties,\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cThe Kiss will be performed immediately?\u201d \u201cAs soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019m looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that",
        "we\u2019ve got him at last. \u2026 I daresay they\u2019ll want to interview you, Snape \u2026 and once young Harry\u2019s back in his right mind, I expect he\u2019ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him. \u2026\u201dHarry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape\u2019s smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and Hermione\u2019s hiding place. Their footsteps died away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they\u2019d really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase, then another, along a new corridor \u2014 then they heard a cackling ahead. \u201cPeeves!\u201d Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione\u2019s wrist. \u201cIn here!\u201d They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head off. \u201cOh, he\u2019s horrible,\u201d whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. \u201cI bet he\u2019s all excited",
        "because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius. \u2026\u201d She checked her watch. \u201cThree minutes, Harry!\u201d They waited until Peeves\u2019s gloating voice had faded into the distance, then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again. \u201cHermione \u2014 what\u2019ll happen \u2014 if we don\u2019t get back inside \u2014 before Dumbledore locks the door?\u201d Harry panted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it!\u201d Hermione moaned, checking her watch again. \u201cOne minute!\u201d They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance. \u201cOkay \u2014 I can hear Dumbledore,\u201d said Hermione tensely. \u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore\u2019s back appeared. \u201cI am going to lock you in,\u201d they heard him saying. \u201cIt is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\u201d Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his",
        "wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache. \u201cWell?\u201d he said quietly.\u201cWe did it!\u201d said Harry breathlessly. \u201cSirius has gone, on Buckbeak. \u2026\u201d Dumbledore beamed at them. \u201cWell done. I think \u2014\u201d He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing. \u201cYes, I think you\u2019ve gone too \u2014 get inside \u2014 I\u2019ll lock you in \u2014\u201d Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office. \u201cDid I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?\u201d She was in a",
        "very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling. \u2026 And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them. \u2026 \u201cWhat was that?\u201d said Madam Pomfrey in alarm. Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door. \u201cReally \u2014 they\u2019ll wake everybody up! What do they think they\u2019re doing?\u201d Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer \u2014 \u201cHe must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out \u2014\u201d \u201cHE DIDN\u2019T DISAPPARATE!\u201d Snape roared, now very close at hand. \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T",
        "APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE!

The door of the hospital wing burst open. Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself. \u201cOUT WITH IT, POTTER!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cWHAT DID YOU DO?\u201d \u201cProfessor Snape!\u201d shrieked Madam Pomfrey. \u201cControl yourself!\u201d \u201cSee here, Snape, be reasonable,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cThis door\u2019s been locked, we just saw \u2014\u201d \u201cTHEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!\u201d Snape howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione.

Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?\u201d \u201cOf course not!\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. \u201cI would have heard them!\u201d \u201cWell, there you have it, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cUnless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see any point in troubling them further.\u201d Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward. \u201cFellow seems quite unbalanced,\u201d said Fudge, staring after him. \u201cI\u2019d watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore.\u201d\u201cOh, he\u2019s not unbalanced,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s just suffered a severe disappointment.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not",
        "the only one!\u201d puffed Fudge. \u201cThe Daily Prophet\u2019s going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff\u2019s escape to get out, and I\u2019ll be a laughingstock! Well \u2026 I\u2019d better go and notify the Ministry. \u2026\u201d \u201cAnd the dementors?\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThey\u2019ll be removed from the school, I trust?\u201d \u201cOh yes, they\u2019ll have to go,\u201d said Fudge, running his fingers distractedly through his hair. \u201cNever dreamed they\u2019d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy. \u2026 Completely out of control \u2026 no, I\u2019ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight. \u2026 Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance. \u2026\u201d \u201cHagrid would like that,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and locked",
        "it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed back to her office. There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up. They could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around. \u201cWhat \u2014 what happened?\u201d he groaned. \u201cHarry? Why are we in here? Where\u2019s Sirius? Where\u2019s Lupin? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Harry and Hermione looked at each other. \u201cYou explain,\u201d said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night andwondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.",
        "Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night. \u2026 A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at them. \u201cKnow I shouldn\u2019 feel happy, after wha\u2019 happened las\u2019 night,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, Black escapin\u2019 again, an\u2019 everythin\u2019 \u2014 but guess what?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d they said, pretending to look curious. \u201cBeaky! He escaped! He\u2019s free! Bin celebratin\u2019 all night!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing. \u201cYeah \u2026 can\u2019t\u2019ve tied him up properly,\u201d said Hagrid, gazing happily out over the grounds. \u201cI was worried this mornin\u2019,",

He lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. \u201cEr \u2014 Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin\u2019. \u2026 Thought everyone\u2019d know by now \u2026 Professor Lupin\u2019s a werewolf, see.

        "see him. I\u2019ll meet you back here.\u201d Lupin\u2019s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The grindylow\u2019s empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door. \u201cI saw you coming,\u201d said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over. It was the Marauder\u2019s Map. \u201cI just saw Hagrid,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd he said you\u2019d resigned. It\u2019s not true, is it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is,\u201d said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents. \u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe Ministry of Magic don\u2019t think you were helping Sirius, do they?\u201d Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry. \u201cNo. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives.\u201d",
        "He sighed. \u201cThat was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he \u2014 er \u2014 accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving just because of that!\u201d said Harry. Lupin smiled wryly. \u201cThis time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents. \u2026 They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you. \u2026 That must never happen again.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we\u2019ve ever had!\u201d said Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d Lupin shook his head and didn\u2019t speak. He carried on emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, \u201cFrom what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot",
        "of lives last night, Harry. If I\u2019m proud of anythingI\u2019ve done this year, it\u2019s how much you\u2019ve learned. \u2026 Tell me about your Patronus.\u201d \u201cHow d\u2019you know about that?\u201d said Harry, distracted. \u201cWhat else could have driven the dementors back?\u201d Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he\u2019d finished, Lupin was smiling again. \u201cYes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guessed right \u2026 that\u2019s why we called him Prongs.\u201d Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry. \u201cHere \u2014 I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,\u201d he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. \u201cAnd \u2026\u201d He hesitated, then held out the Marauder\u2019s Map too. \u201cI am no longer your teacher, so I don\u2019t feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It\u2019s no use to me, and I daresay",
        "you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.\u201d Harry took the map and grinned. \u201cYou told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would\u2019ve wanted to lure me out of school \u2026 you said they\u2019d have thought it was funny.\u201d \u201cAnd so we would have,\u201d said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case. \u201cI have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle.\u201d There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder\u2019s Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket. It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn\u2019t look surprised to see Harry there. \u201cYour carriage is at the gates, Remus,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you, Headmaster.\u201d Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank. \u201cWell \u2014 good-bye, Harry,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cIt has been a real pleasure",
        "teaching you. I feel sure we\u2019ll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage. \u2026\u201dHarry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible. \u201cGood-bye, then, Remus,\u201d said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the office. Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there. \u201cWhy so miserable, Harry?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou should be very proud of yourself after last night.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cPettigrew got away.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t make any difference?\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from",
        "a terrible fate.\u201d Terrible. Something stirred in Harry\u2019s memory. Greater and more terrible than ever before \u2026 Professor Trelawney\u2019s prediction! \u201cProfessor Dumbledore \u2014 yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very \u2014 very strange.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cEr \u2014 stranger than usual, you mean?\u201d \u201cYes \u2026 her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said \u2026 she said Voldemort\u2019s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight. \u2026 She said the servant would help him come back to power.\u201d Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \u201cAnd then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn\u2019t remember anything she\u2019d said. Was it \u2014 was she making a real prediction?\u201d Dumbledore looked mildly impressed. \u201cDo you know, Harry, I think she might have been,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two.",
        "I should offer her a pay raise. \u2026\u201d\u201cBut \u2014\u201d Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly? \u201cBut \u2014 I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!\u201d \u201cIt does not,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cHasn\u2019t your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed. \u2026 Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. \u2026 You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cBut if he helps Voldemort back to power \u2014 !\u201d \u201cPettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. \u2026 When one wizard saves another wizard\u2019s life, it creates a certain bond between them \u2026 and I\u2019m much mistaken if Voldemort wants his",
        "servant in the debt of Harry Potter.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want a connection with Pettigrew!\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe betrayed my parents!\u201d \u201cThis is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me \u2026 the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew\u2019s life.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking. \u201cI knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,\u201d he said gently. \u201cHe would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.\u201d Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t laugh \u2014 he could tell Dumbledore \u2026 \u201cI thought it was my dad who\u2019d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake \u2026 I thought I was seeing him.\u201d \u201cAn easy mistake to make,\u201d said Dumbledore softly. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll tire of hearing it, but you do look",
        "extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes \u2026 you have your mother\u2019s eyes.\u201d Harry shook his head.\u201cIt was stupid, thinking it was him,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI mean, I knew he was dead.\u201d \u201cYou think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don\u2019t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.\u201d It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumbledore had said. \u201cLast night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cAn extraordinary achievement \u2014 not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You",
        "know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night. \u2026 You found him inside yourself.\u201d And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts. Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came close to the truth. Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius\u2019s escape. \u201cIf I manage to get into the Ministry, I\u2019ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!\u201d he",
        "told the only person who would listen \u2014 his girlfriend, Penelope.Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits. He certainly wasn\u2019t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry\u2019s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation. \u201cWonder what they\u2019ll give us next year?\u201d said Seamus Finnigan gloomily. \u201cMaybe a vampire,\u201d suggested Dean Thomas hopefully. It wasn\u2019t only Professor Lupin\u2019s departure that was weighing on Harry\u2019s mind. He couldn\u2019t help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney\u2019s prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering Harry\u2019s spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the",
        "Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on \u2026 his parents\u2019 best friend. \u2026 It would have been the next best thing to having his own father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn\u2019t help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible. The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape\u2019s behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible that Snape\u2019s",
        "dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape\u2019s thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry\u2019s throat.Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a handful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House championship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest. As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning, Hermione gave Harry",
        "and Ron some surprising news. \u201cI went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. I\u2019ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.\u201d \u201cBut you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!\u201d said Ron. \u201cI know,\u201d sighed Hermione, \u201cbut I can\u2019t stand another year like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I\u2019ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies and Divination, I\u2019ll be able to have a normal schedule again.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t tell us about it,\u201d said Ron grumpily. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be your friends.\u201d \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d said Hermione severely. She looked around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain. Two whole months before he\u2019d see it again. \u2026 \u201cOh, cheer up, Harry!\u201d said Hermione sadly. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cJust thinking about the holidays.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about them too,\u201d said",
        "Ron. \u201cHarry, you\u2019ve got to come and stay with us. I\u2019ll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I\u2019ll call you. I know how to use a fellytone now \u2014\u201d \u201cA telephone, Ron,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHonestly, you should take Muggle Studies next year. \u2026\u201dRon ignored her. \u201cIt\u2019s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and stay, and we\u2019ll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.\u201d This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal. \u201cYeah \u2026 I bet the Dursleys\u2019d be pleased to let me come \u2026 especially after what I did to Aunt Marge. \u2026\u201d Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with chocolate in it. But it was late in",
        "the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up. \u2026 \u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing outside your window?\u201d Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in the train\u2019s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry\u2019s seat and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a",
        "sort of dignified disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm\u2019s way. Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the letter, and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s from Sirius!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron and Hermione excitedly. \u201cRead it aloud!\u201d Dear Harry,I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re used to owl post. Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won\u2019t tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job. I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven\u2019t a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse",
        "me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be lifted. There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt \u2014 \u201cHa!\u201d said Hermione triumphantly. \u201cSee! I told you it was from him!\u201d \u201cYes, but he hadn\u2019t jinxed it, had he?\u201d said Ron. \u201cOuch!\u201d The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way. Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays\u2019 worth of presents from your godfather. I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle\u2019s house.",
        "I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you. I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable. If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me. I\u2019ll write again soon. Sirius Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of parchment in there. He read it throughquickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though he\u2019d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp. I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter\u2019s godfather, hereby give him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends. \u201cThat\u2019ll be good enough for Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry happily. He looked back at Sirius\u2019s letter. \u201cHang on, there\u2019s a P.S. \u2026\u201d I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it\u2019s my fault he no",
        "longer has a rat. Ron\u2019s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. \u201cKeep him?\u201d he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment; then, to Harry\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s great surprise, he held him out for Crookshanks to sniff. \u201cWhat do\u2019you reckon?\u201d Ron asked the cat. \u201cDefinitely an owl?\u201d Crookshanks purred. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d said Ron happily. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King\u2019s Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ll call about the World Cup!\u201d Ron yelled after Harry as",
        "Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig\u2019s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. \u201cIf it\u2019s another form for me to sign, you\u2019ve got another \u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d said Harry cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter from my godfather.\u201d \u201cGodfather?\u201d sputtered Uncle Vernon. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a godfather!\u201d \u201cYes, I have,\u201d said Harry brightly. \u201cHe was my mum and dad\u2019s best friend. He\u2019s a convicted murderer, but he\u2019s broken out of wizard prison and he\u2019s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though \u2026 keep up with my news \u2026 check if I\u2019m happy. \u2026\u201d And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon\u2019s face, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for",
        "what looked like a much better summer than the last."
